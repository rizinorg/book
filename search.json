    "section": "",
    "text": "Rizin is a free and open-source reverse engineering framework that delivers a comprehensive binary analysis experience. It focuses on usability, stability, and functional features, striving to create a welcoming environment for developers and users.\nAt its core, Rizin consists of a set of small command-line utilities. These utilities can be used in tandem with Rizin or independently, each serving specific purposes. While this chapter provides a brief introduction to these tools, dedicated sections for each tool can be found at the end of this book for more detailed information.\n\n1.0.1 rizin\nThe primary command line tool within the framework is rizin. It encompasses various features such as a disassembler, hexadecimal editor, and debugger. Rizin enables you to treat multiple input/output sources, such as plain text files, executables, kernel drivers, processes, etc., as if they were straightforward text files.\nIt incorporates a sophisticated command line interface for navigating through the accessed resource, analyzing data, disassembling, patching binaries, comparing data, searching, replacing, and visualizing. Furthermore, scripting capabilities are available with a range of languages, including Python, Haskell, OCaml, JavaScript, and others.\n\n\n1.0.2 rz-bin\nThe rz-bin utility serves the purpose of extracting information from executable binaries, encompassing formats like ELF, PE, Java CLASS, Mach-O, and any other format supported by rizin plugins. Within the core functionality, rz-bin plays a crucial role in obtaining data such as exported symbols, imports, file details, cross references, library dependencies, and sections.\n\n1.0.2.1 Examples\n$ rz-bin -I unknown.bin\n[Info]\narch     x86\ncpu      N/A\nbaddr    0x00000000\nbinsz    0x000213b3\nbintype  elf\nbits     64\nclass    ELF64\ncompiler GCC: (GNU) 13.2.1 20230801\ndbg_file N/A\nendian   LE\nhdr.csum N/A\nguid     N/A\nintrp    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\nladdr    0x00000000\nlang     c\nmachine  AMD x86-64 architecture\nmaxopsz  16\nminopsz  1\nos       linux\ncc       N/A\npcalign  0\nrelro    full\nrpath    NONE\nsubsys   linux\nstripped true\ncrypto   false\nhavecode true\nva       true\nsanitiz  false\nstatic   false\nlinenum  false\nlsyms    false\ncanary   true\nPIE      true\nRELROCS  false\nNX       true\n\n\n\n1.0.3 rz-asm\nThe rz-asm tool operates as a command line assembler and disassembler, catering to various architectures such as Intel x86 and x86-64, MIPS, ARM, PowerPC, Java, and numerous others.\n\n1.0.3.1 Examples\n$ rz-asm -a java 'nop'\n00\n$ rz-asm -a x86 -d '90'\nnop\n$ rz-asm -a x86 -b 32 'mov eax, 33'\nb821000000\n$ echo 'push eax;nop;nop' | rz-asm -f -\n509090\n\n\n\n1.0.4 rz-hash\nrz-hash stands as an implementation of a block-based hash tool. It offers support for a range of algorithms, including MD4, MD5, CRC, SHA1, SHA256, and more, accommodating both small text strings and large files. Its utility extends to checking the integrity or monitoring changes in substantial files and memory dumps.\n\n\n1.0.5 Examples\n$ rz-hash file.bin\nfile.bin: 0x00000000-0x00000007 sha256: 887cfbd0d44aaff69f7bdbedebd282ec96191cce9d7fa7336298a18efc3c7a5a\n$ rz-hash -a md5 file.bin\nfile.bin: 0x00000000-0x00000007 md5: d1833805515fc34b46c2b9de553f599d\n\n\n1.0.6 rz-diff\nThe rz-diff utility serves as a binary diffing tool, implementing various algorithms. It facilitates byte-level or delta diffing for binary files and code-analysis diffing to identify alterations in fundamental code blocks derived from the rizin code analysis.\nThis tool optimally leverages multi-threading to enhance performance, particularly on CPU-intensive and time-consuming tasks.\n\n\n1.0.7 rz-find\nrz-find operates as a program designed to locate byte patterns in files. It provides the capability to search for various types of signatures, including strings in different encodings such as ASCII, UTF-8, wide, and more, across multiple encoding types.\n\n\n1.0.8 rz-gg\nrz-gg is a tool designed to compile programs written in a simple high-level language into compact binaries suitable for x86, x86-64, and ARM architectures.\n\n1.0.8.1 Examples\n$ cat hi.r\n/* hello world in r_egg */\nwrite@syscall(4); //x64 write@syscall(1);\nexit@syscall(1); //x64 exit@syscall(60);\n\nmain@global(128) {\n .var0 = \"hi!\\n\";\n write(1,.var0, 4);\n exit(0);\n}\n$ rz-gg -O -F hi.r\n$ ./hi\nhi!\n\n$ cat hi.c\nmain@global(0,6) {\n write(1, \"Hello0\", 6);\n exit(0);\n}\n$ rz-gg hi.c\n$ ./hi.c.bin\nHello\n\n\n\n1.0.9 rz-run\nrz-run functions as a launcher for executing programs within diverse environments, allowing customization of various aspects such as arguments, permissions, directories, and overridden default file descriptors. This utility proves beneficial for activities like solving crackmes, fuzzing, and running test suites.\nThe versatility of rz-run is evident in its capabilities. Here are a few examples illustrating how it can be utilized:\n\n1.0.9.1 Sample rz-run script\n$ cat foo.rrz\n#!/usr/bin/rz-run\nprogram=./pp400\narg0=10\nstdin=foo.txt\nchdir=/tmp\n#chroot=.\n./foo.rrz\n\n\n1.0.9.2 Connecting a program with a socket\n$ nc -l 9999\n$ rz-run program=/bin/ls connect=localhost:9999\n\n\n1.0.9.3 Debugging a program redirecting STDIO into another terminal\n1 - Open a new terminal and type ‘tty’ to get a terminal name:\n$ tty ; clear ; sleep 999999\n/dev/ttyS010\n2 - Create a new file containing the following rz-run profile named foo.rrz:\n#!/usr/bin/rz-run\nprogram=/bin/ls\nstdio=/dev/ttys010\n3 - Launch the following rizin command:\nrizin -r foo.rrz -d /bin/ls\n\n\n\n1.0.10 rz-ax\nrz-ax stands out as a minimalistic mathematical expression evaluator tailored for the shell. Its utility extends to facilitating base conversions between floating-point values, hexadecimal representations, hexpair strings to ASCII, octal to integer, and more. Notably, it supports endianness settings and can serve as an interactive shell when invoked without arguments.\n\n1.0.10.1 Examples\n$ rz-ax 1337\n0x539\n\n$ rz-ax 0x400000\n4194304\n\n$ rz-ax -b 01111001\ny\n\n$ rz-ax -S rizin\n72616461726532\n\n$ rz-ax -s 617765736f6d65\nawesome",

Rizin is known to compile on a wide range of systems and architectures, including compatibility with TinyCC.\nFor those interested in utilizing Rizin as a debugger for reverse engineering, the debugger layer is currently available on Windows, GNU/Linux (x86, x86_64, MIPS, PowerPC, RISC-V, ARM, and AArch64), macOS (x86, x86_64 and AArch64), FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD (x86 and x86_64).\nHowever, it’s important to note that the debugger feature has more restrictive portability compared to the core. If the debugger hasn’t been ported to your preferred platform, you have the option to disable the debugger layer using the meson option -Ddebugger=false. Refer to BUILDING.md for additional details.\nKeep in mind that there are I/O plugins utilizing GDB, WinDbg, KD, or Wine as back-ends, and they depend on the presence of corresponding third-party tools, especially in the case of remote debugging (on the target machine).\n\n3.0.1 Docker\nThe Rizin repository includes a Dockerfile that you can use with Docker for streamlined deployment.",

You can adjust it as necessary, but something like the following should be a good starting point:\n[binaries]\nc       = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android28-clang'\ncpp     = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android28-clang++'\nar      = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar'\nas      = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-as'\nranlib  = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ranlib'\nld      = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ld'\nstrip   = '/tmp/android-ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android-strip'\npkgconfig = 'false'\n\n[properties]\nsys_root = '/tmp/android-ndk/sysroot'\n\n[host_machine]\nsystem = 'android'\ncpu_family = 'arm'\ncpu = 'aarch64'\nendian = 'little'\n\n\n5.0.2.2.2 Compile with meson + ninja\nNow setup the build directory with meson as usual:\n$ meson --default-library static -Dstatic_runtime=true --prefix=/tmp/android-dir -Dblob=true build --cross-file ./meson-android.ini\nA bit of explanation about all the options: * --default-library static -Dstatic_runtime=true: this ensure that libraries and binaries are statically compiled, so you do not need to properly set LD_* environment variables in your Android environment to make it find the right libraries. Binaries have everything they need inside. * -Dblob=true: it tells meson to compile just one binary with all the needed code for running rizin, rz-bin, rz-asm, etc. and creates symbolic links to those names. This avoids creating many statically compiled large binaries and just create one that provides all features. You will still have rz-bin, rz-asm, rz-ax, etc. but they are just symlinks to rizin. * --cross-file ./meson-android.ini: it describes how to compile rizin for Android\nThen compile and install the project:\n$ ninja -C build\n$ ninja -C build install\n\n\n5.0.2.2.3 Move files to your android device and enjoy\nAt this point you can copy the generated files in /tmp/android-dir to your Android device and running rizin from it.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The initial learning curve tends to be relatively steep. However, within an hour of usage, you should grasp the workings of most features and learn how to effectively utilize the different tools provided by rizin.\nFor a quick introduction to basic commands, execute rizin on the command line and enter help (and press enter) to obtain an overview.\n[0x00000000]&gt; help\nWelcome to Rizin!\n\nType ? for a list of commands available.\nAppend ? to any command to get the list of sub-commands or more details about a specific command.\nAppend ?? to any command to get the full description of a command, e.g. with examples.\n\nCommands output can be redirected as in a regular shell, see &gt;? for more info.\nYou can grep commands output with the 'internal grep', see ~? for more info.\nYou can pipe an internal Rizin command to a system program, see |? for more info.\n\nChain multiple commands with ;.\nTemporary modifiers are your friends, see @? for more info, but here some useful ones:\n - @  temporarily switch to a different address\n - @a:&lt;arch&gt; temporarily switch to a different architecture\n - @e:&lt;varname&gt;=&lt;varvalue&gt; temporarily change an eval variable\n\nThere are a lot of settings that customize Rizin's behaviour, see them with el. Have a look at e? to know how to interact with them.\nYou can save your preferred settings in ~/.rizinrc.\nNote: You have the option to add a ? after any command to access its help, or for more in depth help (which may include examples) you can append ??.\nAdditionally, remember that a comprehensive search for all commands, settings, and their descriptions can be performed by typing ?*.\n\n6.0.1 Internal grep, list commands and environment variables\nWhen utilizing the rizin command line, the internal grep (line filter) is denoted by the character ~.\nThis feature enables users to conveniently locate values, commands, or configurations within Rizin.\nAn illustrative example of using the internal grep is to identify commands that users might not recall or be aware of.\nFor instance, the subsequent command displays all the print commands (p) and selectively shows only those lines containing the keyword base64 (case-insensitive):\n[0x00000000]&gt; ?* p~base64\n| p6e      # Base64 encoding\n| p6d      # Base64 decoding\nIs possible to achieve the same outcome by listing all available commands using the ?* command and then filtering the lines containing a specific keyword using ~, as previously explained.\nThe following example lists all the commands and shows only those containing the keyword summarize (case-insensitive):\n?*~summarize\n| pds [&lt;n_bytes&gt;]  # Summarize N bytes\n| pdsf             # Summarize the current function\n| pdsb             # Summarize current block\nSimilarly, you can perform the same action for listing all environment variables and selectively displaying lines that may contain the specified keyword. Use el* and apply the ~ filter as previously described.\nFor example, the following command filters by the lines containing the keyword color within the environment variables and values.\n[0x00000000]&gt; el*~color\ne log.colors=false\ne scr.color=3\ne scr.color.args=true\ne scr.color.bytes=true\ne scr.color.grep=false\ne scr.color.ops=true\ne scr.color.pipe=false\nIf you are searching for descriptions of Rizin environment variables and want to display only those lines containing the keyword color, you can use the following command:\n[0x00000000]&gt; el~color\n         emu.str.inv: Color-invert emu.str strings\n      graph.gv.graph: Graphviz global style attributes. (bgcolor=white)\n       graph.gv.node: Graphviz node style. (color=gray, style=filled shape=box)\n          log.colors: Should the log output use colors (TODO)\n           scr.color: Enable colors (0: none, 1: ansi, 2: 256 colors, 3: truecolor)\n      scr.color.args: Colorize arguments and variables of functions\n     scr.color.bytes: Colorize bytes that represent the opcodes of the instruction\n      scr.color.grep: Enable colors when using ~grep\n       scr.color.ops: Colorize numbers and registers in opcodes\n      scr.color.pipe: Enable colors when using pipes\n     scr.prompt.mode: Set prompt color based on vi mode\n         scr.rainbow: Shows rainbow colors depending of address\n         scr.randpal: Random color palete or just get the next one from 'eco'\n     scr.visual.mode: Visual mode (0: hexdump, 1: disassembly, 2: debug, 3: color blocks, 4: strings)\nFeel free to explore the rest of this book to gain insights into how certain non-trivial concepts operate and enhance your skills over time.\n\n\n6.0.2 Navigate and print\nNavigation, inspection, and modification of a loaded binary file involve three straightforward actions: seek (to position), print (buffer), and alternate (write, append).\nThe ‘seek’ command is abbreviated as s and takes an expression as its argument. The expression can be something like 10, +0x25, or [0x100+ptr_table]. When dealing with block-based files, you might prefer setting the block size to a required value with the b command and navigating forward or backward with positions aligned to it using sd +1 and sd -1 commands.\nWhen rizin opens an executable file, it defaults to Virtual Addressing (VA) mode, mapping sections to their virtual addresses. In VA mode, seeking is based on the virtual address, and the starting position is set to the entry point of the executable. You can use the -n option to suppress this default behavior and open the file in non-VA mode. In non-VA mode, seeking is based on the offset from the beginning of the file.\nThe ‘print’ command is abbreviated as p and has various submodes, with the second letter specifying the desired print mode. Common variants include px for hexadecimal printing and pd for disassembling.\nTo enable file writing, specify the -w option when opening a file with rizin. The w command allows you to write strings, hexpairs (x subcommand), or even assembly opcodes (a subcommand).\nExamples:\n# Open `foo.bin` in write mode\n$ rizin -w foo.bin\n# writes a string at the current address\n[0x00000000]&gt; w \"hello world\"\n# writes some hexpairs at the current address\n[0x00000000]&gt; wx 90 90 90 90\n# assemble instructions and writes them at the current address\n[0x00000000]&gt; wa \"jmp 0x8048140 ; nop\"\n# writes contents of file at the current address\n[0x00000000]&gt; wff /path/to/file.bin\n\n\n6.0.3 Visual mode and panels\nRizin also offers visual mode via V, visual panels via v.\nOnce you enter visual mode/panel, you can use q to exit visual mode and return to the prompt, and ? to toggle the help message explaining how to navigate within visual mode.\n\n6.0.3.1 Visual mode V\nIn visual mode (activated with the V command), the HJKL keys serve for navigation, corresponding to left, down, up, and right, respectively. These keys are effective in cursor mode, toggled by the c key. To select a byte range in cursor mode, hold down the SHIFT key and use the navigation keys HJKL to mark your selection.\nWhile in visual mode, you can overwrite bytes by pressing i. Press TAB to switch between the hex (middle) and string (right) columns. Exiting the hex panel and returning to visual mode can be done by pressing q. Additionally, you can scroll through different representations in visual mode by pressing p or P. Another notable feature in visual mode is the curses-like panels interface, accessible with the V! command.\nTo enter visual management mode, press v while already in visual mode or use the command line with Vv. This extension of visual mode enables analysis, seeking, viewing cross-references, and more within the same panel.\n\n\n6.0.3.2 Visual panel v\nIn the visual panel, you can utilize both the mouse cursor and keyboard arrows for navigation.\nUnlike V and Vv, this mode provides a GUI-like experience within the terminal emulator. It includes a menu and tabs, enabling the display of multiple pieces of information in the same terminal.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Rizin command line initially displays the current address enclosed by brackets (e.g., [0x00000000]&gt;).\nFollowing these brackets, users can input commands. Typically, commands are represented by a single case-sensitive character.\nRizin includes special commands that enable the execution of shell-like commands. These can be accessed through the help command shell?.\nThe standard format for Rizin commands is as follows:\n# executes a rizin command at at the current address (0x00000000)\n[0x00000000]&gt; command &lt;params&gt;\n# executes a rizin command with a special temporary modifier\n[0x00000000]&gt; command &lt;params&gt; @&lt;temporay modifier&gt;\n# executes a shell command\n[0x00000000]&gt; !&lt;shell command&gt;\n# executes a rizin command and pipes its contents to a shell command\n[0x00000000]&gt; command &lt;params&gt; | &lt;shell command&gt;\nThis format will be consistently used throughout the book.\n\n8.0.1 Help commands\nEvery shell command is accompanied by a description that can be accessed by adding ?. This displays the help descriptions for the individual command and all its subcommands.\nAppending ?? instead provides the help message for the single command (excluding subcommands) along with an extended description, which may include possible examples.\n[0x00000000]&gt; e?\nUsage: e[?]   # List/get/set config evaluable vars\n| e &lt;key&gt;[=&lt;val|?&gt;] [&lt;key&gt;[=&lt;val|?&gt;] ...]] # Get/Set value of config variable &lt;key&gt;\n| el[j*qlJ] [&lt;key&gt;]  # List config variables with their descriptions\n| e-                 # Reset config variables\n| e! &lt;key&gt;           # Invert the boolean value of config variable &lt;key&gt;\n| ec[?]              # Set color for given key (prompt, offset, ...)

The syntax for this approach is as follows: !&lt;shell command&gt;.\n[0x00000000]&gt; !?\nUsage: ![!]   # Run given commands as in system(3) or shows command history\n| !&lt;command&gt; [&lt;args1&gt; &lt;args2&gt; ...]  # Runs given commands in system(3)\n| !!&lt;command&gt; [&lt;args1&gt; &lt;args2&gt; ...] # Runs a given commands in system(3) and pipes stdout to rizin\n# executes `ls /path/to/dir` within the shell of the operating system\n[0x00000000]&gt; !ls /path/to/dir\nsomefile\nThe second method involves using the pipe command |, enabling the redirection of a command’s output (stdout) to an external shell command.\n[0x00000000]&gt; |?\nUsage: &lt;cmd&gt; |[&lt;program&gt;|H|T|.|]   # Pipe help ('|')\n| &lt;cmd&gt; |           # Disable scr.html and scr.color\n| &lt;cmd&gt; |H          # Enable scr.html, respect scr.color\n| &lt;cmd&gt; | &lt;program&gt; # Pipe output of command to program\n| &lt;cmd&gt; |.          # Alias for .&lt;cmd&gt;\n# executes the `iz` rizin command and redirects the output to the external command `grep \"hello\"`\n[0x00000000]&gt; iz | grep \"hello\"\n\n\n8.0.3 Temporary modifiers\nWhen utilizing the Rizin command-line, users may encounter situations where they need to temporarily modify specific values or configurations before executing a command. This can be accomplished using the @ commands.\n[0x00000000]&gt; @?\nUsage: &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;@&gt; &lt;args&gt;   # '@' help, temporary modifiers\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @ &lt;addr&gt;             # Temporary seek to &lt;addr&gt;\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @ ..&lt;addr&gt;           # Temporary partial address seek (see s..)\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @!&lt;blocksize&gt;        # Temporary change the block size\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @(&lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;)       # Temporary set from and to for commands supporting ranges\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @a:&lt;arch&gt;[:&lt;bits&gt;]   # Temporary set arch and bits, if specified\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @b:&lt;bits&gt;            # Temporary set asm.bits\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @B:&lt;nth&gt;             # Temporary seek to nth instruction in current basic block (negative numbers too)\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @e:&lt;k&gt;=&lt;v&gt;[,&lt;k&gt;=&lt;v&gt;] # Temporary change eval vars (multiple vars separated by comma)\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @f:&lt;file&gt;            # Temporary replace block with file contents\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @F:&lt;flagspace&gt;       # Temporary change flag space\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @i:&lt;nth.op&gt;          # Temporary seek to the Nth relative instruction\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @k:&lt;key&gt;             # Temporary seek at value of sdb key `key`\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @o:&lt;fd&gt;              # Temporary switch to another fd\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @r:&lt;reg&gt;             # Temporary seek to register value\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @s:&lt;string&gt;          # Temporary replace block with string\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @v:&lt;value&gt;           # Temporary replace block with value, written according to asm.bits and cfg.bigendian\n| &lt;cmd&gt; @x:&lt;hexstring&gt;       # Temporary replace block with hexstring\n# execute `px 16` (print hexadecimal) at address 0x100\n[0x00000000]&gt; px 16 @ 0x100\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x00000100  ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff  ................\n# execute `px` (print hexadecimal) with a block size of `10 bytes` \n# and replace the block with 00112233445566778822 hex bytes.\n[0x00000000]&gt; px @!10 @x:00112233445566778822\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x00000000  0011 2233 4455 6677 8822                 ..\"3DUfw.\"\nMultiple temporary commands can be used simultaneously, requiring them to be space-separated. For instance: @!10 @x:0011223344 @e:cfg.bigendian=true @ 0x12345.\n\n\n8.0.4 Pipe output to file\nIn certain situations, users may need to save output to a file. This can be achieved by using &gt;, similar to how it’s done in the UNIX shell.\n[0x00000000]&gt; &gt;?\nUsage: &lt;cmd&gt; &gt; &lt;arg&gt;   # Redirection help ('&gt;')\n| &lt;cmd&gt; &gt; &lt;file&gt;|&lt;$alias&gt;  # Redirect STDOUT of &lt;cmd&gt; to &lt;file&gt; or save it to an alias (see $?)\n| &lt;cmd&gt; 2&gt; &lt;file&gt;|&lt;$alias&gt; # Redirect STDERR of &lt;cmd&gt; to &lt;file&gt; or save it to an alias (see $?)\n| &lt;cmd&gt; H&gt; &lt;file&gt;|&lt;$alias&gt; # Redirect HTML output of &lt;cmd&gt; to &lt;file&gt; or save it to an alias (see $?)\n# execute `iij` (print import as JSON) and redirect the output to file\n[0x00000000]&gt; iij &gt; imports.json\n# execute `pr 128` (raw print) of 128 bytes at the address 0x1234 and \n# redirect the output to file.\n# this allows to dump n-bytes at the current address to a file\n[0x00000000]&gt; pr 128 @ 0x1234 &gt; dump.bin\n[0x00000000]&gt; !hexdump -C dump.bin \n00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n00000080\n\n\n8.0.5 Executing multiple commands on a single line\nThe Rizin command line employs the ; character to separate commands, enabling the execution of multiple commands in a single line.\n[0x00000000]&gt; px 20 ; pd 3 ; px 40\n\n\n8.0.6 Repeat a command n-times\nIt is possible to execute a command repeatedly, by prepending the command with a numerical value:\n# executes `px`\n[0x00000000]&gt; px\n# executes `px` 3 times\n[0x00000000]&gt; 3 px\n\n\n8.0.7 Filtering (grep) output lines\nFiltering the output of an Rizin command is possible with any shell program that reads from stdin, such as grep, less, or wc, by utilizing the | pipe command. However, if spawning external processes is not desirable, possible, or the target system lacks essential UNIX tools (as is the case for Windows or embedded systems), you can also employ the built-in grep (~).\n[0x00000000]&gt; ~?\nUsage: &lt;command&gt;~[modifier][word,word][endmodifier][[column]][:line]   # Internal grep help ('~')\n\nModifiers:\n| &      # All words must match to grep the line\n| $[n]   # Sort numerically / alphabetically the Nth column\n| $!     # Sort in inverse order\n| ,      # Token to define another keyword\n| +      # Set the grep as the opposite of search.case_sensitive\n| ^      # Words must be placed at the beginning of line\n| &lt;      # Perform zoom operation on the buffer\n| !      # Negate grep\n| ?      # Count number of matching lines\n| ?.     # Count number chars\n| :s..e  # Show lines s-e\n| ..     # Internal 'less'\n| ...    # Internal 'hud' (like V_)\n| {:     # Human friendly indentation (yes, it's a smiley)\n| {:..   # Less the output of {:\n| {:...  # Hud the output of {:\n| {}     # Json indentation\n| {}..   # Less json indentation\n| {}...  # Hud json indentation\n| {path} # Json path grep\n\nEndModifiers:\n| $ # Words must be placed at the end of line\n\nColumns:\n| [n]     # Show only columns n\n| [n-m]   # Show column n to m\n| [n-]    # Show all columns starting from column n\n| [i,j,k] # Show the columns i, j and k\n\nExamples:\n| i~:0     # Show first line of 'i' output\n| i~:-2..  # Show from the second-last line to the last line of 'i' output\n| i~:..3   # Show first three lines of 'i' output\n| i~:2..5  # Show three lines of 'i' output starting from 2nd line\n| pd~mov   # Disasm and grep for mov\n| pi~[0]   # Show only opcode\n| i~0x400$ # Show lines ending with 0x400\nMoreover, you can employ grep for either columns (using [n]) or rows (using :n). For instance:\n# get first row\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20~call:0 \n# get second row\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20~call:1 \n# get first column\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20~call[0]\n# get second column\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20~call[1]\n# Alternatively, you can combine them.\n# This filters the first column of the first row matching 'call'.\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20~call:0[0]\nThe internal grep function is a crucial feature for scripting in Rizin.\n\n\n8.0.8 Iterators and loops\nIt allows iteration over a list of offsets or data generated by the disassembler, ranges, or any other command. For more information, refer to the loops section (iterators).\n\n\n8.0.9 Examples of shell usage.\nHere are a few examples of shell usage:\n[0x00000000]&gt; ds                    # call the debugger's 'step' command\n[0x00000000]&gt; px 200 @ esp          # show 200 hex bytes at esp\n[0x00000000]&gt; pc &gt; file.c           # dump buffer as a C byte array to file.c\n[0x00000000]&gt; wx 90 @@is            # write a nop on every symbol\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 2000 | grep eax    # grep opcodes that use the 'eax' register\nThe @ character is used to specify a temporary offset at which the command to its left will be executed. The original seek position in a file is then restored.\nFor example, pd 5 @ 0x100000fce to disassemble 5 instructions at address 0x100000fce.\nMost of the commands offer autocompletion support using &lt;TAB&gt; key, for example seek or flags commands. It offers autocompletion using all possible values, taking flag names in this case. Note that it is possible to see the history of the commands using the !~... command - it offers a visual mode to scroll through the rizin command history.\nTo extend the autocompletion support to handle more commands or enable autocompletion to your own commands defined in core, I/O plugins you must use the !!! command.",

Pressing p or P allows you to cycle through other visual mode views. Utilize F7 or s to step into and F8 or S to step over the current instruction. The c key toggles cursor mode to mark a byte range selection (e.g., for later overwriting with NOP). Breakpoints can be set with the F2 key.\nIn visual mode, you can input regular Rizin commands by prefixing them with :. For instance, to dump a block of memory contents at ESI:\n&lt;Press ':'&gt;\nx @ esi\nTo obtain help on visual mode, press ?. Use arrows to scroll through the help screen, and to exit the help view, press q.\nA commonly used command is dr, which is employed to read or write values of the target’s general-purpose registers. For a more concise register value representation, you can use the dr= command. Additionally, you have the ability to manipulate the hardware and extended/floating-point registers.",

    "text": "This chapter provides instructions on configuring and customizing Rizin to meet your preferences.\nDuring the startup, Rizin loads an initial script called rizinrc. Within this file, it is possible to incorporate configuration commands (e commands) to customize the tool.\nAll the configuration adjustments in Rizin are made through the use of e commands. A standard startup configuration file often resembles the following:\n$ cat ~/.rizinrc\n# enable colors\ne scr.color=2\n# enable utf8 output\ne scr.utf8=true\ne scr.utf8.curvy=true\n# change color theme to nord\neco nord\nConfiguration adjustments can also be made using the -e option=value command-line option. This allows you to modify configurations from the command line while keeping the rizinrc file unchanged. For instance, to initiate Rizin with an empty configuration and subsequently modify scr.color and asm.syntax, the following line can be employed:\n$ rizin -N -e scr.color=1 -e asm.syntax=intel -d /bin/ls\nThe evaluable variables are named using namespaces, such as cfg., file., dbg., scr., and others.\nTo obtain a list of all configuration variables, enter el in the command line prompt. If you want to filter the output by a specific namespace, append the namespace to el. For example, el file will display all evaluable variables starting with the file prefix.\nFor configuration values that can assume one of several options, you can employ the =? operator to obtain a list of valid values.\nFor guidance on the e command, refer to e?.\n[0x00000000]&gt; e?\nUsage: e[?]   # List/get/set config evaluable vars\n| e &lt;key&gt;[=&lt;val|?&gt;] [&lt;key&gt;[=&lt;val|?&gt;] ...]] # Get/Set value of config variable &lt;key&gt;\n| el[j*qlJ] [&lt;key&gt;]      # List config variables with their descriptions\n| e-                     # Reset config variables\n| e! &lt;key&gt;               # Invert the boolean value of config variable &lt;key&gt;\n| ec[?]                  # Set color for given key (prompt, offset, ...)

    "text": "13.1 Themes\nThe console access is encapsulated in an API that enables displaying the output of any command in ANSI, Win32 Console, or HTML formats. This functionality enables rizin to operate within environments with restricted display capabilities, such as kernels or embedded devices. You can still receive data from it in your preferred format.\nThe color option is referred to as scr.color and can be modified using the e command. The scr.color option offers support for four values: - e scr.color=0: no colors (black and white) - e scr.color=1: ANSI colors (16 basic ANSI colors) - e scr.color=2: 256 colors (256 scale colors) - e scr.color=3: truecolor (24bit true color)\nTo change color support by default, include a corresponding configuration option in the rizinrc initial script.\nFor example:\nThe inclusion of user-defined options is necessary because there is no standardized or portable method for terminal programs to inquire about the console for optimal configurations. This also applies to charset encodings, so Rizin allows manual selection.\nTypically, serial consoles may function well with options 0 (no colors) or 1 (ANSI), while more moderns terminals might support up to 3 (truecolor).\nRizin will attempt to discover the closest color scheme for your theme when selecting a theme using the eco command.\nIt is feasible to configure the color of nearly any element in the disassembly output. For UNIX-like terminals, Rizin accepts color specifications in RGB format. To alter the console color palette, use the ec command.\nYou have the option to craft your custom color theme, although Rizin comes with its predefined ones. Utilize the eco command to view or choose from them (eco &lt;theme name&gt;).\nIn visual panel mode (command V), you can switch themes by pressing R (Shift + R, or uppercase R). If you enable scr.randpal by setting it to true, you can randomize the palette similar to what ecr does.",

The list of potential values can be retrieved by examining the output of e asm.arch=? or rz-asm -L.\nAdding new architectures for disassembling and analyzing code is a straightforward process with a dedicated interface. For x86, this interface facilitates the integration of various third-party disassembler engines, such as GNU binutils, and a selection of custom ones.\n\n\n14.1.2 asm.bits: int\nThe asm.bits configuration variable dictates the width in bits of registers for the current architecture. The supported values vary depending on the architecture, and you can explore them by using rz-asm -L or e asm.bits=?.\n\n\n14.1.3 asm.bytes: bool\nWhen asm.bytes is set to true, it enables the display of raw bytes of instructions.

When activated, the raw bytes will be shown alongside the instructions.\n# you can disable this also via `e asm.bytes=false`\n[0x00005fa0]&gt; pd 5 @e:asm.bytes=false\n            ;-- entry0:\n            0x00005fa0      endbr64\n            0x00005fa4      xor   ebp, ebp\n            0x00005fa6      mov   r9, rdx\n            0x00005fa9      pop   rsi\n            0x00005faa      mov   rdx, rsp\n# you can enable this also via `e asm.bytes=true`\n[0x00005fa0]&gt; pd 5 @e:asm.bytes=true\n            ;-- entry0:\n            0x00005fa0      f30f1efa       endbr64\n            0x00005fa4      31ed           xor   ebp, ebp\n            0x00005fa6      4989d1         mov   r9, rdx\n            0x00005fa9      5e             pop   rsi\n            0x00005faa      4889e2         mov   rdx, rsp\n\n\n14.1.4 asm.cpu: string\nThe asm.cpu configuration variable enables you to specify the CPU type. For example, if you’ve chosen the architecture as AVR, you can designate your CPU type (e.g., ATmega1281, ATmega2561, etc.) using asm.cpu. To view all available CPU types of the selected architecture, you can use the command e asm.cpu=?.\n\n\n14.1.5 asm.platform: string\nThe asm.platform configuration variable allows you to choose the platform, and it will load the corresponding platform profile during analysis. Refer to the section about CPU and platform profiles for more information.\n\n\n14.1.6 asm.flags: bool\nWhen asm.flags is set to true, the disassembler view will include the flags column.\n\n\n14.1.7 asm.fcn.size: bool\nThe asm.fcn.size variable is employed to show the size of the function in the disassembly. By default, it is set to false, and enabling it would lead to a disassembly format similar to the one below:\n# you can enable this also via `e asm.fcn.size=true`\n[0x00004050]&gt; pd 10 @e:asm.fcn.size=true\n            ; DATA XREF from entry0 @ 0x5fb8\n/ 7992: int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp);\n| stack: 31 (vars 31, args 0)\n| rg: 2 (vars 0, args 2)\n|           0x00004050      endbr64\n|           0x00004054      push  r15\n|           0x00004056      push  r14\n|           0x00004058      push  r13\n|           0x0000405a      push  r12\n|           0x0000405c      push  rbp\n|           0x0000405d      push  rbx\n|           0x0000405e      sub   rsp, 0xf8\n|           0x00004065      mov   rbx, qword [rsi]                     ; argv\n|           0x00004068      mov   dword [var_118h], edi                ; argc\nHere, 7992 is the size of the function.\n\n\n14.1.8 asm.lines.call: bool\nWhen asm.lines.call is set to true, lines are drawn at the left of the disassembly output (pd, pD commands). These lines graphically represent control flow changes, such as jumps and calls, that are targeted inside the current block. Also, refer to asm.lines.out.\n\n\n14.1.9 asm.lines.out: bool\nWhen asm.lines.out is set to true, the disassembly view will draw control flow lines that extend beyond the block.\n\n\n14.1.10 asm.offset: bool\nThe asm.offset configuration variable determines whether to show or hide offsets for individual disassembled instructions.\n\n\n14.1.11 asm.os: string\nThe asm.os configuration variable lets you select a target operating system for the currently loaded binary. Typically, the OS is automatically detected by Rizin (command i or via rz-bin -I /path/to/bin). However, asm.os can be employed to switch to a different syscall table used by another OS.\n\n\n14.1.12 asm.pseudo: bool\nThe asm.pseudo configuration variable is a boolean value used to set the pseudo syntax in the disassembly. When set to false, it indicates a native syntax defined by the current architecture. When set to true, it activates a pseudocode strings format; this feature can be beneficial when disassembling obscure architectures.\n# you can disable this also via `e asm.pseudo=false`\n[0x00100508]&gt; pd 10 @e:asm.pseudo=false\n            ;-- _start:\n/ entry0(int64_t arg_18h, int64_t arg_8h, int64_t arg_10h, int64_t arg1, int64_t arg2, int64_t arg4, int64_t arg5);\n|           ; arg int64_t arg1 @ r3\n|           ; arg int64_t arg2 @ r4\n|           ; arg int64_t arg4 @ r6\n|           ; arg int64_t arg5 @ r7\n|           ; var int64_t var_1h @ stack - 0x1\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_8h @ stack + 0x8\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_10h @ stack + 0x10\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_18h @ stack + 0x18\n|           0x00100508      lis   r2, 0x1e                             ; start.S:65 ; 0x1e0000\n|                                                                      ; sym..iplt\n|           0x0010050c      addi  r2, r2, 0x7c00\n|           0x00100510      mr    r9, r1                               ; start.S:67\n|           0x00100514      rldicr r1, r1, 0, 0x3b                     ; start.S:69\n|           0x00100518      li    r0, 0                                ; start.S:70\n|           0x0010051c      stdu  r1, -0x80(r1)                        ; start.S:71\n|           0x00100520      mtlr  r0                                   ; start.S:72\n|           0x00100524      std   r0, 0(r1)                            ; start.S:73\n|           0x00100528      ld    r8, -0x7ff0(r2)                      ; start.S:77 ; 0x194c40\n|                                                                      ; sym..rodata\n|       ,=&lt; 0x0010052c      b     0x101048                             ; start.S:80\n# you can enable this also via `e asm.pseudo=true`\n[0x00100508]&gt; pd 10 @e:asm.pseudo=true\n            ;-- _start:\n/ entry0(int64_t arg_18h, int64_t arg_8h, int64_t arg_10h, int64_t arg1, int64_t arg2, int64_t arg4, int64_t arg5);\n|           ; arg int64_t arg1 @ r3\n|           ; arg int64_t arg2 @ r4\n|           ; arg int64_t arg4 @ r6\n|           ; arg int64_t arg5 @ r7\n|           ; var int64_t var_1h @ stack - 0x1\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_8h @ stack + 0x8\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_10h @ stack + 0x10\n|           ; arg int64_t arg_18h @ stack + 0x18\n|           0x00100508      r2 = (0x1e &lt;&lt; 16)                          ; start.S:65 ; 0x1e0000\n|                                                                      ; sym..iplt\n|           0x0010050c      r2 += 0x7c00\n|           0x00100510      r9 = r1                                    ; start.S:67\n|           0x00100514      r1 = rol64(r1, 0) & 0x1f                   ; start.S:69\n|           0x00100518      r0 = 0                                     ; start.S:70\n|           0x0010051c      [r1 - 0x80] = r1                           ; start.S:71\n|           0x00100520      lr = r0                                    ; start.S:72\n|           0x00100524      [r1 + 0] = r0                              ; start.S:73\n|           0x00100528      r8 = [r2 - 0x7ff0]                         ; start.S:77 ; 0x194c40\n|                                                                      ; sym..rodata\n|       ,=&lt; 0x0010052c      goto 0x101048                              ; start.S:80\n\n\n14.1.13 asm.sub.jmp: bool\nThe asm.sub.jmp configuration variable substitutes jump, call, and branch targets with function names in the disassembly.

    "text": "Initial scripts like the rizinrc, binrc or ${filename}.rz are loaded during startup.\nIt is possible to prevent Rizin from parsing the scripts, by using the -N or -NN options.\nThese scripts are interpreted as commands by the Rizin command-line and can be situated in the following locations:\n\nSystem directory (also named as system within rizin -hh): This location is situated within the system and will be loaded by all users of the system.\nUser home directory (also named as user within rizin -hh): This location is user-specific and will be loaded exclusively for the individual user.\nBinary format directory (also named as binrc within rizin -hh): This location is user-specific and will be loaded exclusively for the individual user; These scripts will be executed when the matching type of binary is loaded when executing rizin.\nInitial binary script (also named as file within rizin -hh): When Rizin encounters a script with the same filename as the binary, along with a .rz extension, it is loaded and executed. Rizin will display a prompt (unless interactive mode is disabled) upon loading the binary.\n\nThe actual paths of these directories depend on the environment, build flags, and operating system, but they can be viewed by executing rizin -hh (with double h) in the terminal.\nNote: You can also override the rizinrc path within the terminal by setting the RZ_RCFILE environment variable before executing rizin.\n\n15.0.1 Examples of rizinrc scripts\nHere’s a demonstration of loading an rizinrc file in various environments.\nThese examples will show the content of the rizinrc file and their output upon executing rizin.\nPlease note that clippy is a command within the Rizin command-line, and executing it will produce a message on the terminal.\n\nExample of rizinrc within linux, macOS (or any UNIX-like environements).\n\n$ cat ~/.rizinrc\nclippy 'This is executed from $HOME/.rizinrc'\n$ rizin\n .--.     .--------------------------------------.\n |   \\    |                                      |\n | O o   &lt;  This is executed from $HOME/.rizinrc |\n |   | /  |                                      |\n |  ( /   `--------------------------------------'\n |   / \n `--'\n[0x00000000]&gt; q\n$ cat some/folder/myrizinrc\nclippy 'This is executed elsewhere'\n$ export RZ_RCFILE=\"some/folder/myrizinrc\"\n$ rizin\n .--.     .----------------------------.\n | _|_    |                            |\n | O O   &lt;  This is executed elsewhere |\n |  ||    |                            |\n | _:|    `----------------------------'\n |   |\n `---'\n[0x00000000]&gt; q\n\nExample of rizinrc within Windows.\n\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rizin&gt; type %HOME%\\.rizinrc\nclippy 'This is executed from %HOME%/.rizinrc'\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rizin&gt; rizin.exe\n .--.     .---------------------------------------.\n |   \\    |                                       |\n | O o   &lt;  This is executed from %HOME%/.rizinrc |\n |   | /  |                                       |\n |  ( /   `---------------------------------------'\n |   / \n `--'\n[0x00000000]&gt; q\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rizin&gt; type some\\folder\\myrizinrc\nclippy 'This is executed elsewhere'\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rizin&gt; set RZ_RCFILE=\"some\\folder\\myrizinrc\"\nC:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\rizin&gt; rizin.exe\n .--.     .----------------------------.\n | _|_    |                            |\n | O O   &lt;  This is executed elsewhere |\n |  ||    |                            |\n | _:|    `----------------------------'\n |   |\n `---'\n[0x00000000]&gt; q\n\n\n15.0.2 Example of initial binary script\nHere’s a demonstration of loading an initial Rizin script in the same directory as the binary.

    "title": "17  Basic Commands",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Most command names in rizin are derived from action names. They should be easy to remember, as they are short. Actually, all commands are single letters. Subcommands or related commands are specified using the second character of the command name. For example, / foo is a command to search plain string, while /x 90 90 is used to look for hexadecimal pairs.\nThe general format for a valid command (as explained in the Rizin Command-line chapter) looks like this:\n[.][times][cmd][~grep][@[@iter]addr!size][|&gt;pipe] ; ...\nFor example,\n&gt; 3s +1024    ; seeks three times 1024 from the current seek\nIf a command starts with R!, the rest of the string is passed to the currently loaded IO plugin (a debugger, for example). Most plugins provide help messages with R!? or R!help.\n$ rizin -d /bin/ls\n&gt; R!help      ; handled by the IO plugin\nIf a command starts with !, posix_system() is called to pass the command to your shell. Check !? for more options and usage examples.\n&gt; !ls         ; run `ls` in the shell\nThe meaning of the arguments (iter, addr, size) depends on the specific command. As a rule of thumb, most commands take a number as an argument to specify the number of bytes to work with, instead of the currently defined block size. Some commands accept math expressions or strings.\n&gt; px 0x17     ; show 0x17 bytes in hexs at current seek\n&gt; s base+0x33 ; seeks to flag 'base' plus 0x33\n&gt; / lib       ; search for 'lib' string.\nThe @ sign is used to specify a temporary offset location or a seek position at which the command is executed, instead of current seek position. This is quite useful as you don’t have to seek around all the time.\n&gt; p8 10 @ 0x4010  ; show 10 bytes at offset 0x4010\n&gt; f patata @ 0x10 ; set 'patata' flag at offset 0x10\nUsing @@ sub-commands you can execute a single command on a list of flags, functions, symbols, etc.. You can think of these as foreach operations:\n&gt; s 0\n&gt; / lib             ; search 'lib' string\n&gt; p8 20 @@f:hit0_*   ; show 20 hexpairs at each search hit\nThe &gt; operation is used to redirect the output of a command into a file (overwriting it if it already exists).\n&gt; pr &gt; dump.bin   ; dump 'raw' bytes of current block to file named 'dump.bin'\n&gt; f  &gt; flags.txt  ; dump flag list to 'flags.txt'\nThe | operation (pipe) is similar to what you are used to expect from it in a *NIX shell: an output of one command as input to another.\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt; f | grep section | grep text\n0x0805f3b0 512 section._text\n0x080d24b0 512 section._text_end\nYou can pass several commands in a single line by separating them with a semicolon ;:\n&gt; px ; dr\nUsing _, you can print the result that was obtained by the last command.\n[0x00001060]&gt; axt 0x00002004\nmain 0x1181 [DATA] lea rdi, str.argv__2d_:__s\n[0x00001060]&gt; _\nmain 0x1181 [DATA] lea rdi, str.argv__2d_:__s",

    "text": "18.1 Open file\nTo move around the file we are inspecting we will need to change the offset at which we are using the s command.\nThe argument is a math expression that can contain flag names, parenthesis, addition, subtraction, multiplication of immediates of contents of memory using brackets.\nSome example commands:\nObserve how the prompt offset changes. The first line moves the current offset to the address 0x10.\nThe second does a relative seek 4 bytes forward.\nAnd finally, the last 2 commands are undoing, and redoing the last seek operations in the seek history.\nInstead of using just numbers, we can use complex expressions, or basic arithmetic operations to represent the address to seek.\nTo do this, check the ?$? Help message which describes the internal variables that can be used in the expressions. For example, this is the same as doing sd +4 .\nFrom the debugger (or when emulating) we can also use the register names as references. They are loaded as flags with the .dr* command, which happens under the hood.\nHere’s the full help of the s command. We will explain in more detail below.\nIf you want to inspect the result of a math expression, you can evaluate it using the ? command. Simply pass the expression as an argument. The result can be displayed in hexadecimal, decimal, octal or binary formats.\nThere are also subcommands of % that display the output in one specific format (base 10, base 16 ,…). See %v for instance.\nIn the visual mode, you can press u (undo) or U (redo) inside the seek history to return back to previous or forward to the next location.\nAs a test file, let’s use a simple hello_world.c compiled in Linux ELF format. After we compile it let’s open it with rizin:\nNow we have the command prompt:\nAnd it is time to go deeper.",

The sections define the contents of a portion of the file that can be mapped in memory (or not). What is mapped is defined by the segments.\nBefore the IO refactoring done by condret, the S command was used to manage what we now call maps. Currently the S command is deprecated because iS and om should be enough.\nFirmware images, bootloaders and binary files usually place various sections of a binary at different addresses in memory. To represent this behavior, rizin offers the iS. Use iS? to get the help message. To list all created sections use iS (or iSj to get the json format). The iS= will show the region bars in ascii-art.\nYou can create a new mapping using the om subcommand as follows:\nom fd vaddr [size] [paddr] [rwx] [name]\nFor Example:\n[0x0040100]&gt; om 4 0x00000100 0x00400000 0x0001ae08 rwx test\nYou can also use oml command to view information about mapped sections:\n[0x00401000]&gt; oml\n 6 fd: 4 +0x0001ae08 0x00000100 - 0x004000ff rwx test\n 5 fd: 3 +0x00000000 0x00000000 - 0x0000055f r-- fmap.LOAD0\n 4 fd: 3 +0x00001000 0x00001000 - 0x000011e4 r-x fmap.LOAD1\n 3 fd: 3 +0x00002000 0x00002000 - 0x0000211f r-- fmap.LOAD2\n 2 fd: 3 +0x00002de8 0x00003de8 - 0x0000402f r-- fmap.LOAD3\n 1 fd: 4 +0x00000000 0x00004030 - 0x00004037 rw- mmap.LOAD3\nUse om? to get all the possible subcommands. To list all the defined maps use oml (or omlj to get the json format). To get the ascii art view use oml=.\nIt is also possible to delete the mapped section using the om- mapid command.\nFor Example:\n[0x00401000]&gt; om- 6",

    "text": "Rizin’s I/O subsystem allows you to map the contents of files into the same I/O space used to contain a loaded binary. New contents can be placed at random offsets.\nThe o command permits the user to open a file, this is mapped at offset 0 unless it has a known binary header and then the maps are created in virtual addresses.\nSometimes, we want to rebase a binary, or maybe we want to load or map the file in a different address.\nWhen launching rizin, the base address can be changed with the -B flag. But you must notice the difference when opening files with unknown headers, like bootloaders, so we need to map them using the -m flag (or specifying it as argument to the o command).\nrizin is able to open files and map portions of them at random places in memory specifying attributes like permissions and name. It is the perfect basic tooling to reproduce an environment like a core file, a debug session, by also loading and mapping all the libraries the binary depends on.\nOpening files (and mapping them) is done using the o (open) command. Let’s read the help:\n[0x00000000]&gt; o?\nUsage: o[?]   # Open files and handle opened files\n| o &lt;file&gt; [&lt;addr&gt; [&lt;perm&gt;]] # Open &lt;file&gt;\n| o+ &lt;file&gt; [&lt;addr&gt; [&lt;perm&gt;]] # Open &lt;file&gt; in write mode\n| ol[jqt]                # List opened files\n| ol.[jqt]               # Show currently opened file\n| o- &lt;fd&gt;                # Close file descriptor\n| o--                    # Close all files\n| oc &lt;file&gt;              # Close all opened files and open &lt;file&gt;, like relaunching rizin\n| oC &lt;len&gt;               # Open a 'malloc://&lt;len&gt;' file, copying the bytes from current offset\n| on[+]                  # Open files without parsing binary info\n| oo[+bcdmn?]            # Reopen current file\n| oL[jqt] [&lt;path&gt;]       # List all IO plugins / Register IO plugin from &lt;path&gt;\n| o=                     # List opened files in ASCII-art bars\n| oa &lt;arch&gt; &lt;bits&gt; [&lt;filename&gt;] # Specify &lt;arch&gt; and &lt;bits&gt; for the file &lt;filename&gt; or the current one if none is specified\n| ob[?]                  # Handle binary files\n| ou &lt;fd&gt;                # Use specified &lt;fd&gt;\n| op[npr]                # Select prioritized file\n| om[?]                  # Handle IO maps\n| ox &lt;fd&gt; &lt;fdx&gt;          # Exchange the descs of &lt;fd&gt; and &lt;fdx&gt; and keep the mapping\nPrepare a simple layout:\n$ rz-bin -l /bin/ls\n[Linked libraries]\nlibselinux.so.1\nlibrt.so.1\nlibacl.so.1\nlibc.so.6\n\n4 libraries\nMap a file:\n[0x00001190]&gt; o /bin/zsh 0x499999\nList mapped files:\n[0x00000000]&gt; ol\n- 6 /bin/ls @ 0x0 ; r\n- 10 /lib/ld-linux.so.2 @ 0x100000000 ; r\n- 14 /bin/zsh @ 0x499999 ; r\nPrint hexadecimal values from /bin/zsh:\n[0x00000000]&gt; px @ 0x499999\nUnmap files using the o- command.

    "text": "One of the key features of rizin is displaying information in many formats. The goal is to offer a selection of display choices to interpret binary data in the best possible way.\nBinary data can be represented as integers, shorts, longs, floats, timestamps, hexpair strings, or more complex formats like C structures, disassembly listings, decompilation listing, be a result of an external processing…\nBelow is a list of available print modes listed by p?:\n[0x00005310]&gt; p?\n|Usage: p[=68abcdDfiImrstuxz] [arg|len] [@addr]\n| p[b|B|xb] [len] ([S])   bindump N bits skipping S bytes\n| p[iI][df] [len]         print N ops/bytes (f=func) (see pi? and pdi)\n| p[kK] [len]             print key in randomart (K is for mosaic)\n| p-[?][jh] [mode]        bar|json|histogram blocks (mode: el search.in)\n| p2 [len]                8x8 2bpp-tiles\n| p3 [file]               print stereogram (3D)\n| p6[de] [len]            base64 decode/encode\n| p8[?][j] [len]          8bit hexpair list of bytes\n| p=[?][bep] [N] [L] [b]  show entropy/printable chars/chars bars\n| pa[edD] [arg]           pa:assemble  pa[dD]:disasm or pae: esil from hex\n| pA[n_ops]               show n_ops address and type\n| pb[?] [n]               bitstream of N bits\n| pB[?] [n]               bitstream of N bytes\n| pc[?][p] [len]          output C (or python) format\n| pC[aAcdDxw] [rows]      print disassembly in columns (see hex.cols and pdi)\n| pd[?] [sz] [a] [b]      disassemble N opcodes (pd) or N bytes (pD)\n| pf[?][.nam] [fmt]       print formatted data (pf.name, pf.name $&lt;expr&gt;)\n| pF[?][apx]              print asn1, pkcs7 or x509\n| pg[?][x y w h] [cmd]    create new visual gadget or print it (see pg? for details)\n| ph[?][=|hash] ([len])   calculate hash for a block\n| pj[?] [len]             print as indented JSON\n| pm[?] [magic]           print libmagic data (see pm? and /m?)\n| po[?] hex               print operation applied to block (see po?)\n| pp[?][sz] [len]         print patterns, see pp? for more help\n| pq[?][is] [len]         print QR code with the first Nbytes\n| pr[?][glx] [len]        print N raw bytes (in lines or hexblocks, 'g'unzip)\n| ps[?][pwz] [len]        print pascal/wide/zero-terminated strings\n| pt[?][dn] [len]         print different timestamps\n| pu[?][w] [len]          print N url encoded bytes (w=wide)\n| pv[?][jh] [mode]        show variable/pointer/value in memory\n| pwd                     display current working directory\n| px[?][owq] [len]        hexdump of N bytes (o=octal, w=32bit, q=64bit)\n[0x00005310]&gt;\nTip: when using json output, you can append the ~{} to the command to get a pretty-printed version of the output:\n[0x00000000]&gt; oj\n[{\"raised\":false,\"fd\":563280,\"uri\":\"malloc://512\",\"from\":0,\"writable\":true,\"size\":512,\"overlaps\":false}]\n[0x00000000]&gt; oj~{}\n[\n    {\n        \"raised\": false,\n        \"fd\": 563280,\n        \"uri\": \"malloc://512\",\n        \"from\": 0,\n        \"writable\": true,\n        \"size\": 512,\n        \"overlaps\": false\n    }\n]\nFor more on the magical powers of ~ see the help in ?@?, and the Rizin Command-line chapter earlier in the book.\n\n22.0.1 Hexadecimal View\npx gives a user-friendly output showing 16 pairs of numbers per row with offsets and raw representations:\n\n\n\nhexprint\n\n\n\n22.0.1.1 Show Hexadecimal Words Dump (32 bits)\n\n\n\nwordprint\n\n\n\n\n22.0.1.2 8 bits Hexpair List of Bytes\n[0x00404888]&gt; p8 16\n31ed4989d15e4889e24883e4f0505449\n\n\n22.0.1.3 Show Hexadecimal Quad-words Dump (64 bits)\n\n\n\npxq\n\n\n\n\n\n22.0.2 Date/Time Formats\nCurrently supported timestamp output modes are:\n[0x00404888]&gt; pt?\n|Usage: pt [dn]  print timestamps\n| pt.  print current time\n| pt   print UNIX time (32 bit `cfg.bigendian`) Since January 1, 1970\n| ptd  print DOS time (32 bit `cfg.bigendian`) Since January 1, 1980\n| pth  print HFS time (32 bit `cfg.bigendian`) Since January 1, 1904\n| ptn  print NTFS time (64 bit `cfg.bigendian`) Since January 1, 1601\nFor example, you can ‘view’ the current buffer as timestamps in the ntfs time:\n[0x08048000]&gt; e cfg.bigendian=false\n[0x08048000]&gt; pt 4\n29:04:32948 23:12:36 +0000\n[0x08048000]&gt; e cfg.bigendian=true\n[0x08048000]&gt; pt 4\n20:05:13001 09:29:21 +0000\nAs you can see, the endianness affects the result. Once you have printed a timestamp, you can grep the output, for example, by year:\n[0x08048000]&gt; pt ~1974 | wc -l\n15\n[0x08048000]&gt; pt ~2022\n27:04:2022 16:15:43 +0000\nThe default date format can be configured using the cfg.datefmt variable. Formatting rules for it follow the well known strftime(3) format. Check the manpage for more details, but these are the most important:\n%a  The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to the current locale.\n%A  The full name of the day of the week according to the current locale.\n%d  The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).\n%D  Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.  (Yecch—for Americans only).\n%H  The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).\n%I  The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).\n%m  The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).\n%M  The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).\n%p  Either \"AM\" or \"PM\" according to the given time value.\n%s  The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00  +0000 (UTC). (TZ)\n%S  The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)\n%T  The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).  (SU)\n%y  The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).\n%Y  The year as a decimal number including the century.\n%z  The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and minute offset from UTC). (SU)\n%Z  The timezone name or abbreviation.\n\n\n22.0.3 Basic Types\nThere are print modes available for all basic types. If you are interested in a more complex structure, type pf?? for format characters and pf??? for examples:\n[0x00499999]&gt; pf??\n|pf: pf[.k[.f[=v]]|[v]]|[n]|[0|cnt][fmt] [a0 a1 ...]\n| Format:\n|  b       byte (unsigned)\n|  B       resolve enum bitfield (see t?)\n|  c       char (signed byte)\n|  C       byte in decimal\n|  d       0xHEX value (4 bytes) (see 'i' and 'x')\n|  D       disassemble one opcode\n|  e       temporally swap endian\n|  E       resolve enum name (see t?)\n|  f       float value (4 bytes)\n|  F       double value (8 bytes)\n|  i       signed integer value (4 bytes) (see 'd' and 'x')\n|  n       next char specifies size of signed value (1, 2, 4 or 8 byte(s))\n|  N       next char specifies size of unsigned value (1, 2, 4 or 8 byte(s))\n|  o       octal value (4 byte)\n|  p       pointer reference (2, 4 or 8 bytes)\n|  q       quadword (8 bytes)\n|  r       CPU register `pf r (eax)plop`\n|  s       32bit pointer to string (4 bytes)\n|  S       64bit pointer to string (8 bytes)\n|  t       UNIX timestamp (4 bytes)\n|  T       show Ten first bytes of buffer\n|  u       uleb128 (variable length)\n|  w       word (2 bytes unsigned short in hex)\n|  x       0xHEX value and flag (fd @ addr) (see 'd' and 'i')\n|  X       show formatted hexpairs\n|  z       null terminated string\n|  Z       null terminated wide string\n|  ?       data structure `pf ?

The default size is like in many other commands: the block size, which can be changed with the b command.\nWe can also just temporarily override this block size by expressing it as an argument.\n[0xB7F8E810]&gt; pc 32\n#define _BUFFER_SIZE 32\nunsigned char buffer[_BUFFER_SIZE] = {\n0x89, 0xe0, 0xe8, 0x49, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x89, 0xc7, 0xe8, 0xe2, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x81, 0xc3, 0xd6, 0xa7, 0x01, 0x00, 0x8b, 0x83, 0x00, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x5a, 0x8d, 0x24, 0x84, 0x29, 0xc2 };\nThat cstring can be used in many programming languages, not just C.\n[0x7fcd6a891630]&gt; pcs\n\"\\x48\\x89\\xe7\\xe8\\x68\\x39\\x00\\x00\\x49\\x89\\xc4\\x8b\\x05\\xef\\x16\\x22\\x00\\x5a\\x48\\x8d\\x24\\xc4\\x29\\xc2\\x52\\x48\\x89\\xd6\\x49\\x89\\xe5\\x48\\x83\\xe4\\xf0\\x48\\x8b\\x3d\\x06\\x1a\n\n\n22.0.5 Strings\nStrings are probably one of the most important entry points when starting to reverse engineer a program because they usually reference information about functions’ actions (asserts, debug or info messages…). Therefore, rizin supports various string formats:\n[0x00000000]&gt; ps?\n|Usage: ps[bijqpsuwWxz+] [N]  Print String\n| ps       print string\n| ps+[j]   print libc++ std::string (same-endian, ascii, zero-terminated)\n| psb      print strings in current block\n| psi      print string inside curseek\n| psj      print string in JSON format\n| psp[j]   print pascal string\n| psq      alias for pqs\n| pss      print string in screen (wrap width)\n| psu[zj]  print utf16 unicode (json)\n| psw[j]   print 16bit wide string\n| psW[j]   print 32bit wide string\n| psx      show string with escaped chars\n| psz[j]   print zero-terminated string\nMost strings are zero-terminated. Below there is an example using the debugger to continue the execution of a program until it executes the ‘open’ syscall. When we recover the control over the process, we get the arguments passed to the syscall, pointed by %ebx. In the case of the ‘open’ call, it is a zero terminated string which we can inspect using psz.\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt; dcs open\n0x4a14fc24 syscall(5) open ( 0x4a151c91 0x00000000 0x00000000 ) = 0xffffffda\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt; dr\n  eax  0xffffffda    esi  0xffffffff    eip    0x4a14fc24\n  ebx  0x4a151c91    edi  0x4a151be1    oeax   0x00000005\n  ecx  0x00000000    esp  0xbfbedb1c    eflags 0x200246\n  edx  0x00000000    ebp  0xbfbedbb0    cPaZstIdor0 (PZI)\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt;\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt; psz @ 0x4a151c91\n/etc/ld.so.cache\n\n\n22.0.6 Print Memory Contents\nIt is also possible to print various packed data types using the pf command:\n[0xB7F08810]&gt; pf xxS @ rsp\n0x7fff0d29da30 = 0x00000001\n0x7fff0d29da34 = 0x00000000\n0x7fff0d29da38 = 0x7fff0d29da38 -&gt; 0x0d29f7ee /bin/ls\nThis can be used to look at the arguments passed to a function. To achieve this, simply pass a ‘format memory string’ as an argument to pf, and temporally change the current seek position/offset using @. It is also possible to define arrays of structures with pf. To do this, prefix the format string with a numeric value. You can also define a name for each field of the structure by appending them as a space-separated arguments list.\n[0x4A13B8C0]&gt; pf 2*xw pointer type @ esp\n0x00404888 [0] {\n   pointer :\n(*0xffffffff8949ed31)      type : 0x00404888 = 0x8949ed31\n   0x00404890 = 0x48e2\n}\n0x00404892 [1] {\n(*0x50f0e483)    pointer : 0x00404892 = 0x50f0e483\n     type : 0x0040489a = 0x2440\n}\nA practical example for using pf on a binary of a GStreamer plugin:\n$ rizin /usr/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgsttcp.so\n -- Move the comments to the right changing their margin with asm.cmt.margin\n[0x00005020]&gt; aa; pdf @ sym.gst_plugin_tcp_get_desc\n[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)\n┌ 8: sym.gst_plugin_tcp_get_desc ();\n│ bp: 0 (vars 0, args 0)\n│ sp: 0 (vars 0, args 0)\n│ rg: 0 (vars 0, args 0)\n│           0x000127f0      lea rax, section..data.rel.ro              ; 0x1d460\n└           0x000127f7      ret\n[0x00005020]&gt; s section..data.rel.ro\n[0x0001d460]&gt; pf ii*z*zp*z*z*z*z*z*z major minor name desc init version license source package origin release_datetime\n            major : 0x0001d460 = 1\n            minor : 0x0001d464 = 18\n             name : (*0x15c8e)0x0001d468 = \"tcp\"\n             desc : (*0x17c88)0x0001d470 = \"transfer data over the network via TCP\"\n             init : 0x0001d478 = (qword)0x0000000000011430\n          version : (*0x15d0b)0x0001d480 = \"1.18.2\"\n          license : (*0x15d3e)0x0001d488 = \"LGPL\"\n           source : (*0x15d2d)0x0001d490 = \"gst-plugins-base\"\n          package : (*0x17cb0)0x0001d498 = \"GStreamer Base Plugins (Arch Linux)\"\n           origin : (*0x15d12)0x0001d4a0 = \"https://www.archlinux.org/\"\n release_datetime : (*0x15d43)0x0001d4a8 = \"2020-12-06\"\n\n\n22.0.7 Disassembly\nThe pd command is used to disassemble code.

All these options are described in el asm.\n[0x00005310]&gt; el asm.\nasm.analysis: Analyze code and refs while disassembling (see analysis.strings)\nasm.arch: Set the arch to be used by asm\nasm.assembler: Set the plugin name to use when assembling\nasm.bbline: Show empty line after every basic block\nasm.bits: Word size in bits at assembler\nasm.bytes: Display the bytes of each instruction\nasm.bytespace: Separate hexadecimal bytes with a whitespace\nasm.calls: Show callee function related info as comments in disasm\nasm.capitalize: Use camelcase at disassembly\nasm.cmt.col: Column to align comments\nasm.cmt.flgrefs: Show comment flags associated to branch reference\nasm.cmt.fold: Fold comments, toggle with Vz\n...\nCurrently there are 136 asm. configuration variables so we do not list them all.\n\n\n22.0.10 Disassembly Syntax\nThe asm.syntax variable is used to change the flavor of the assembly syntax used by a disassembler engine. To switch between Intel and AT&T representations:\ne asm.syntax=intel\ne asm.syntax=att\nYou can also check asm.pseudo, which is an experimental pseudocode view, and asm.esil which outputs ESIL (‘Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language’). ESIL’s goal is to have a human-readable representation of every opcode semantics. Such representations can be evaluated (interpreted) to emulate effects of individual instructions.\n\n\n22.0.11 Print gadgets\nIn Rizin, visual gadgets allows the users to cast or display the output of a particular Rizin command anywhere on the screen while in Visual mode. This command is unrelated with displaying ROP Gadgets.\nUsing the commands under pg (print gadgets), we can add, remove and change the location of these visual gadgets. You can add a gadget using pg:\npg 10 10 10 10 ddr\nThis will add the output of the Rizin command ddr be printed on the screen. The four arguments to be passed are the position (like coordinates) and the height and width of the gadget you would like to see. This command requires the configuration variable scr.gadgets to be turned on.\nSee pg? for more information.",

    "text": "Flags are conceptually similar to bookmarks. They associate a name with a given offset in a file. Flags can be grouped into ‘flagspaces’. A flagspace is a namespace for flags, grouping together flags of similar characteristics or type. Examples for flagspaces: sections, registers or symbols.\nTo create a flag:\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; f flag_name @ offset\nYou can remove a flag by appending the - character to command. Most commands accept - as argument-prefix as an indication to delete something.\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; f-flag_name\nTo switch between or create new flagspaces use the fs command:\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fs?\nUsage: fs[l-mrs?]   # Manage flagspaces\n| fs &lt;name&gt;     # Add the flagspace\n| fsl[jq]       # Display flagspaces\n| fs- &lt;name&gt;    # Remove the flagspace\n| fs-*          # Remove all flagspaces\n| fsm           # Move the flags at the current address to the current flagspace\n| fsr &lt;newname&gt; # Rename the flag space\n| fss&lt;+-l&gt;      # Manage the flagspace stack\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fsl\n|    0 * classes\n| 108 * functions\n|  84 * imports\n|   0 * platform.ports\n|  87 * pointers\n|   0 * registers\n|   0 * registers.extended\n|   0 * registers.mmio\n|  91 * relocs\n|  13 * sections\n|   3 * segments\n|  95 * strings\n|  55 * symbols\nHere you can find some command examples using flagspaces:\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fs symbols     ; select only flags in symbols flagspace\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fsl\n    0 . classes\n  108 . functions\n   84 . imports\n    0 . platform.ports\n   87 . pointers\n    0 . registers\n    0 . registers.extended\n    0 . registers.mmio\n   91 . relocs\n   13 . sections\n    3 . segments\n   95 . strings\n   55 * symbols              ; symbols are selected\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fl            ; list only flags in symbols flagspace\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; fs *          ; select all flagspaces\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; f myflag      ; create a new flag called 'myflag'\n[0x100003ba0]&gt; f-myflag      ; delete the flag called 'myflag'\nYou can rename flags with fr.\n\n23.0.1 Local flags\nEvery flag name should be unique for addressing reasons. But it is quite a common need to have the flags, for example inside the functions, with simple and ubiquitous names like loop or return. For this purpose you can use so called “local” flags, which are tied to the function where they reside. It is possible to add them using f. command:\n[0x00003a04]&gt; pd 10\n│      0x00003a04      48c705c9cc21.  mov qword [0x002206d8], 0xffffffffffffffff ;\n[0x2206d8:8]=0\n│      0x00003a0f      c60522cc2100.  mov byte [0x00220638], 0     ; [0x220638:1]=0\n│      0x00003a16      83f802         cmp eax, 2\n│  .─&lt; 0x00003a19      0f84880d0000   je 0x47a7\n│  │   0x00003a1f      83f803         cmp eax, 3\n│ .──&lt; 0x00003a22      740e           je 0x3a32\n│ ││   0x00003a24      83e801         sub eax, 1\n│.───&lt; 0x00003a27      0f84ed080000   je 0x431a\n││││   0x00003a2d      e8fef8ffff     call sym.imp.abort           ; void abort(void)\n││││   ; CODE XREF from main (0x3a22)\n││╰──&gt; 0x00003a32      be07000000     mov esi, 7\n[0x00003a04]&gt; f. localflag @ 0x3a32\n[0x00003a04]&gt; f.\n0x00003a32 localflag   [main + 210]\n[0x00003a04]&gt; pd 10\n│      0x00003a04      48c705c9cc21.  mov qword [0x002206d8], 0xffffffffffffffff ;\n[0x2206d8:8]=0\n│      0x00003a0f      c60522cc2100.  mov byte [0x00220638], 0     ; [0x220638:1]=0\n│      0x00003a16      83f802         cmp eax, 2\n│  .─&lt; 0x00003a19      0f84880d0000   je 0x47a7\n│  │   0x00003a1f      83f803         cmp eax, 3\n│ .──&lt; 0x00003a22      740e           je 0x3a32                    ; main.localflag\n│ ││   0x00003a24      83e801         sub eax, 1\n│.───&lt; 0x00003a27      0f84ed080000   je 0x431a\n││││   0x00003a2d      e8fef8ffff     call sym.imp.abort           ; void abort(void)\n││││   ; CODE XREF from main (0x3a22)\n││`──&gt;  .localflag:\n││││   ; CODE XREF from main (0x3a22)\n││`──&gt; 0x00003a32      be07000000     mov esi, 7\n[0x00003a04]&gt;\n\n\n23.0.2 Flag Zones\nRizin offers flag zones, which lets you label different offsets on the scrollbar, for making it easier to navigate through large binaries. You can set a flag zone on the current seek using:\n[0x00003a04]&gt; fz flag-zone-name\nSet e scr.scrollbar=1 and go to the Visual mode, to see your flag zone appear on the scrollbar on the right end of the window.\nSee fz? for more information.",

You can resize the file, move and copy/paste bytes, insert new bytes (shifting data to the end of the block or file), or simply overwrite bytes. New data may be given as a wide-string, assembler instructions, or the data may be read in from another file.\nResize the file using the r command. It accepts a numeric argument. A positive value sets a new size for the file.

It is used in all rizin subshells - main prompt, SDB shell, visual prompt, and offsets prompt. It also implements the most common features and keybindings compatible with the GNU Readline.\nDietline supports two major configuration modes : Emacs-mode and Vi-mode.\nIt also supports the famous Ctrl-R reverse history search. Using TAB key it allows to scroll through the autocompletion options.\nIn the every shell and rizin command autocompletion is supported. There are multiple modes of it - files, flags, and SDB keys/namespaces. To provide the easy way to select possible completion options the scrollable popup widget is available. It can be enabled with scr.prompt.popup, just set it to the true (as such: e scr.prompt.popup=true).",

Sometimes you would like to view it as a decimal, binary or even custom defined constant. To change value format you can use d following by i then choose what base to work in, this is the equivalent to ahi:\nd → i → ...\n0x004048f7      48c1e83f       shr rax, 0x3f\nd → i →  10\n0x004048f7      48c1e83f       shr rax, 63\nd → i →  2\n0x004048f7      48c1e83f       shr rax, '?'\n\n30.2.1 Usage of the Cursor for Inserting/Patching…\nRemember that, to be able to actually edit files loaded in rizin, you have to start it with the -w option. Otherwise a file is opened in read-only mode.\nPressing lowercase c toggles the cursor mode. When this mode is active, the currently selected byte (or byte range) is highlighted.\n\n\n\nCursor at 0x00404896\n\n\nThe cursor is used to select a range of bytes or simply to point to a byte. You can use the cursor to create a named flag at specific location. To do so, seek to the required position, then press f and enter a name for a flag. If the file was opened in write mode using the -w flag or the o+ command, you can also use the cursor to overwrite a selected range with new values. To do so, select a range of bytes (with HJKL and SHIFT key pressed), then press i and enter the hexpair values for the new data. The data will be repeated as needed to fill the range selected. For example:\n&lt;select 10 bytes in visual mode using SHIFT+HJKL&gt;\n&lt;press 'i' and then enter '12 34'&gt;\nThe 10 bytes you have selected will be changed to “12 34 12 34 12 …”.\nThe Visual Assembler is a feature that provides a live-preview while you type in new instructions to patch into the disassembly. To use it, seek or place the cursor at the wanted location and hit the ‘A’ key. To provide multiple instructions, separate them with semicolons, ;.",

For example, to look for AES keys in physical memory of your system:\n$ sudo rizin /dev/mem\n[0x00000000]&gt; /ca\n0 AES keys found\nIf you are simply looking for plaintext AES keys in your binary, /Ca will not find them, but you might want to search with is~AES instead if the programmer left those hints for you:\n[0x00000000]&gt; /Ca\nSearching 0 byte in [0x100000-0x1f0000]\nhits: 0\nSearching 0 byte in [0x196e4-0x1b91c]\nhits: 0\nSearching 0 byte in [0x194b4-0x196e4]\nhits: 0\nSearching 0 byte in [0x8000-0x114b4]\nhits: 0\n[0x00000000]&gt; is~AES\n010 0x000096d4 0x000196d4 GLOBAL    OBJ   16 AES_KEY\nOther than that, AES keys might show up in different ways in the binary: encrypted, hidden by another encrypting routine, so there’s no absolute way other than understanding the binary being analyzed. For instance, p=e might give some hints if high(er) entropy sections are found trying to cover up a hardcoded secret. As an example on entropy searching, since rizin 3.2.0, there’s the possibility to delimit entropy sections for later use like so:\n[0x00000000]&gt; b\n0x100\n[0x00000000]&gt; b 4096\n[0x00000000]&gt; /s\n0x00100000 - 0x00101000 ~ 5.556094\n0x014e2c88 - 0x014e3c88 ~ 0.000000\n0x01434374 - 0x01435374 ~ 6.332087\n0x01435374 - 0x0144c374 ~ 3.664636\n0x0144c374 - 0x0144d374 ~ 1.664368\n0x0144d374 - 0x0144f374 ~ 4.229199\n0x0144f374 - 0x01451374 ~ 2.000000\n(...)\n[0x00000000]&gt; /s*\nf entropy_section_0 0x00001000 0x00100000\nf entropy_section_1 0x00001000 0x014e2c88\nf entropy_section_2 0x00001000 0x01434374\nf entropy_section_3 0x00017000 0x01435374\nf entropy_section_4 0x00001000 0x0144c374\nf entropy_section_5 0x00002000 0x0144d374\nf entropy_section_6 0x00002000 0x0144f374\nThe blocksize is increased to 4096 bytes from the default 100 bytes so that the entropy search /s can work on reasonably sized chunks for entropy analysis.

    "text": "Disassembling in rizin is just a way to represent an array of bytes. It is handled as a special print mode within p command.\nIn the old times, when the rizin core was smaller, the disassembler was handled by an external rsc file. That is, rizin first dumped current block into a file, and then simply called objdump configured to disassemble for Intel, ARM or other supported architectures.\nIt was a working and unix friendly solution, but it was inefficient as it repeated the same expensive actions over and over, because there were no caches. As a result, scrolling was terribly slow.\nSo there was a need to create a generic disassembler library to support multiple plugins for different architectures. We can list the current loaded plugins with\n$ rz-asm -L\nOr from inside rizin:\n&gt; e asm.arch=??\nThis was many years before capstone appeared. So rizin was using udis86 and olly disassemblers, many gnu (from binutils).\nNowadays, the disassembler support is one of the basic features of rizin. It now has many options, endianness, including target architecture flavor and disassembler variants, among other things.\nTo see the disassembly, use the pd command. It accepts a numeric argument to specify how many opcodes of current block you want to see. Most of the commands in rizin consider the current block size as the default limit for data input. If you want to disassemble more bytes, set a new block size using the b command.\n[0x00000000]&gt; b 100    ; set block size to 100\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd       ; disassemble 100 bytes\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 3     ; disassemble 3 opcodes\n[0x00000000]&gt; pD 30    ; disassemble 30 bytes\nYou can also pass negative numbers as the numeric argument, if you want to disassemble something that lies before the current offset:\n[0x00005bc0]&gt; pd -2\n            0x00005bb8      ret\n            0x00005bb9      nop dword [rax]\n[0x00005bc0]&gt; pd 2\n            ;-- entry.fini0:\n            0x00005bc0      endbr64\n            0x00005bc4      cmp byte [0x000232c8], 0\nThe pD command works like pd but accepts the number of input bytes as its argument, instead of the number of opcodes.\nYou can also get information about the pointer chains using the command pdp. This can be helpful while dealing with ROP chains.\nThe “pseudo” syntax may be somewhat easier for a human to understand than the default assembler notations. But it can become annoying if you read lots of code. To play with it:\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; e asm.pseudo=true\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; pd 3\n          ; JMP XREF from 0x00405dfa (fcn.00404531)\n          0x00405e1c    488b9424a80. rdx = [rsp+0x2a8]\n          0x00405e24    64483314252. rdx ^= [fs:0x28]\n          0x00405e2d    4889d8       rax = rbx\n\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; e asm.syntax=intel\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; pd 3\n          ; JMP XREF from 0x00405dfa (fcn.00404531)\n          0x00405e1c    488b9424a80. mov rdx, [rsp+0x2a8]\n          0x00405e24    64483314252. xor rdx, [fs:0x28]\n          0x00405e2d    4889d8       mov rax, rbx\n\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; e asm.syntax=att\n[0x00405e1c]&gt; pd 3\n          ; JMP XREF from 0x00405dfa (fcn.00404531)\n          0x00405e1c    488b9424a80. mov 0x2a8(%rsp), %rdx\n          0x00405e24    64483314252. xor %fs:0x28, %rdx\n          0x00405e2d    4889d8       mov %rbx, %rax\nAnd as always, you can print the disassembly in JSON using pdj and get more information about the other associated commands by running pd?.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The typical work involved in reversing binary files makes powerful annotation capabilities essential. Rizin offers multiple ways to store and retrieve such metadata.\nBy following common basic UNIX principles, it is easy to write a small utility in a scripting language which uses objdump, otool or any other existing utility to obtain information from a binary and to import it into rizin. For example, take a look at python-idb-based rz-ida.py which opens IDB files directly without IDA Pro installed. You can load the resulting file with the . (dot) command into the rizin:\n[0x00000000]&gt; . file.rz\nThe C command is used to manage comments and data conversions. You can define a range of program’s bytes to be interpreted as either code, binary data or string. It is also possible to execute external code at every specified flag location in order to fetch some metadata, such as a comment, from an external file or database.\nThere are many different metadata manipulation commands, here is the glimpse of all of them:\n[0x00404cc0]&gt; C?\n| Usage: C[-LCvsdfm*?][*?] [...]   # Metadata management\n| C                                              list meta info in human friendly form\n| C*                                             list meta info in rizin commands\n| C*.                                            list meta info of current offset in rizin commands\n| C- [len] [[@]addr]                             delete metadata at given address range\n| C.                                             list meta info of current offset in human friendly form\n| CC!

Three basic types are: code (disassembly is done using asm.arch), data (an array of data elements) or string. Use the Cs command to define a string, use the Cd command for defining an array of data elements, and use the Cf command to define more complex data structures like structs.\nAnnotating data types is most easily done in visual mode, using the “d” key, short for “data type change”. First, use the cursor to select a range of bytes (press c key to toggle cursor mode and use HJKL keys to expand selection), then press ‘d’ to get a menu of possible actions/types. For example, to mark the range as a string, use the ‘s’ option from the menu. You can achieve the same result from the shell using the Cs command:\n[0x00000000]&gt; f string_foo @ 0x800\n[0x00000000]&gt; Cs 10 @ string_foo\nThe Cf command is used to define a memory format string (the same syntax used by the pf command). Here’s an example:\n[0x7fd9f13ae630]&gt; Cf 16 2xi foo bar\n[0x7fd9f13ae630]&gt; pd\n;-- rip:\n0x7fd9f13ae630 format 2xi foo bar {\n0x7fd9f13ae630 [0] {\n foo : 0x7fd9f13ae630 = 0xe8e78948\n bar : 0x7fd9f13ae634 = 14696\n}\n0x7fd9f13ae638 [1] {\n foo : 0x7fd9f13ae638 = 0x8bc48949\n bar : 0x7fd9f13ae63c = 571928325\n}\n} 16\n0x7fd9f13ae633    e868390000   call 0x7fd9f13b1fa0\n0x7fd9f13ae638    4989c4       mov r12, rax\nThe [sz] argument to Cf is used to define how many bytes the struct should take up in the disassembly, and is completely independent from the size of the data structure defined by the format string. This may seem confusing, but has several uses. For example, you may want to see the formatted structure displayed in the disassembly, but still have those locations be visible as offsets and with raw bytes. Sometimes, you find large structures, but only identified a few fields, or only interested in specific fields. Then, you can tell rizin to display only those fields, using the format string and using ‘skip’ fields, and also have the disassembly continue after the entire structure, by giving it full size using the sz argument.\nUsing Cf, it’s easy to define complex structures with simple one-liners. See pf? for more information. Remember that all these C commands can also be accessed from the visual mode by pressing the d (data conversion) key. Note that unlike t commands Cf doesn’t change analysis results. It is only a visual boon.\nSometimes just adding a single line of comments is not enough, in this case rizin allows you to create a link for a particular text file. You can use it with CC, command or by pressing , key in the visual mode. This will open an $EDITOR to create a new file, or if filename does exist, just will create a link. It will be shown in the disassembly comments:\n[0x00003af7 11% 290 /bin/ls]&gt; pd $r @ main+55 # 0x3af7\n│0x00003af7  call sym.imp.setlocale        ;[1] ; ,(locale-help.txt) ; char *setlocale(int category, const char *locale)\n│0x00003afc  lea rsi, str.usr_share_locale ; 0x179cc ; \"/usr/share/locale\"\n│0x00003b03  lea rdi, [0x000179b2]         ; \"coreutils\"\n│0x00003b0a  call sym.imp.bindtextdomain   ;[2] ; char *bindtextdomain(char *domainname, char *dirname)\nNote ,(locale-help.txt) appeared in the comments, if we press , again in the visual mode, it will open the file. Using this mechanism we can create a long descriptions of some particular places in disassembly, link datasheets or related articles.",

    "text": "44.1 Using ESIL\nESIL stands for ‘Evaluable Strings Intermediate Language’. It aims to describe a Forth-like representation for every target CPU opcode semantics. ESIL representations can be evaluated (interpreted) in order to emulate individual instructions. Each command of an ESIL expression is separated by a comma. Its virtual machine can be described as this:\nAs we can see ESIL uses a stack-based interpreter similar to what is commonly used for calculators. You have two categories of inputs: values and operators. A value simply gets pushed on the stack, an operator then pops values (its arguments if you will) off the stack, performs its operation and pushes its results (if any) back on. We can think of ESIL as a post-fix notation of the operations we want to do.\nSo let’s see an example:\nCan you guess what this is? If we take this post-fix notation and transform it back to in-fix we get\nWe can see that this corresponds to the x86 instruction push ebp! Isn’t that cool? The aim is to be able to express most of the common operations performed by CPUs, like binary arithmetic operations, memory loads and stores, processing syscalls. This way if we can transform the instructions to ESIL we can see what a program does while it is running even for the most cryptic architectures you definitely don’t have a device to debug on for.\nrizin’s visual mode is great to inspect the ESIL evaluations.\nThere are 3 environment variables that are important for watching what a program does:\nasm.emu tells rizin if you want ESIL information to be displayed. If it is set to true, you will see comments appear to the right of your disassembly that tell you how the contents of registers and memory addresses are changed by the current instruction. For example, if you have an instruction that subtracts a value from a register it tells you what the value was before and what it becomes after. This is super useful so you don’t have to sit there yourself and track which value goes where.\nOne problem with this is that it is a lot of information to take in at once and sometimes you simply don’t need it. rizin has a nice compromise for this. That is what the emu.str variable is for (asm.emustr on &lt;= 2.2). Instead of this super verbose output with every register value, this only adds really useful information to the output, e.g., strings that are found at addresses a program uses or whether a jump is likely to be taken or not.\nThe third important variable is asm.esil. This switches your disassembly to no longer show you the actual disassembled instructions, but instead now shows you corresponding ESIL expressions that describe what the instruction does. So if you want to take a look at how instructions are expressed in ESIL simply set “asm.esil” to true.\nIn visual mode you can also toggle this by simply typing O.",

    "text": "44.4 Arguments Order for Non-associative Operations\nAs discussed on IRC, the current implementation works like this:\na,b,-      b - a\na,b,/=     b /= a\nThis approach is more readable, but it is less stack-friendly.\n\n44.4.1 Special Instructions\nNOPs are represented as empty strings. As it was said previously, syscalls are marked by ‘\\(' command. For example, '0x80,\\)’. It delegates emulation from the ESIL machine to a callback which implements syscalls for a specific OS/kernel.\nTraps are implemented with the TRAP command. They are used to throw exceptions for invalid instructions, division by zero, memory read error, or any other needed by specific architectures.\n\n\n44.4.2 Quick Analysis\nHere is a list of some quick checks to retrieve information from an ESIL string. Relevant information will be probably found in the first expression of the list.\nindexOf('[')    -&gt; have memory references\nindexOf(\"=[\")   -&gt; write in memory\nindexOf(\"pc,=\") -&gt; modifies program counter (branch, jump, call)\nindexOf(\"sp,=\") -&gt; modifies the stack (what if we found sp+= or sp-=?)\nindexOf(\"=\")    -&gt; retrieve src and dst\nindexOf(\":\")    -&gt; unknown esil, raw opcode ahead\nindexOf(\"$\")    -&gt; accesses internal esil vm flags ex: $z\nindexOf(\"$\")    -&gt; syscall ex: 1,$\nindexOf(\"TRAP\") -&gt; can trap\nindexOf('++')   -&gt; has iterator\nindexOf('--')   -&gt; count to zero\nindexOf(\"?{\")   -&gt; conditional\nequalsTo(\"\")    -&gt; empty string, aka nop (wrong, if we append pc+=x)\nCommon operations: * Check dstreg * Check srcreg * Get destination * Is jump * Is conditional * Evaluate * Is syscall\n\n\n44.4.3 CPU Flags\nCPU flags are usually defined as single bit registers in the RReg profile. They are sometimes found under the ‘flg’ register type.\n\n\n44.4.4 Variables\nProperties of the VM variables:\n\nThey have no predefined bit width. This way it should be easy to extend them to 128, 256 and 512 bits later, e.g. for MMX, SSE, AVX, Neon SIMD.\nThere can be unbound number of variables. It is done for SSA-form compatibility.\nRegister names have no specific syntax. They are just strings.\nNumbers can be specified in any base supported by RNum (dec, hex, oct, binary …).\nEach ESIL backend should have an associated RReg profile to describe the ESIL register specs.\n\n\n\n44.4.5 Bit Arrays\nWhat to do with them? What about bit arithmetic if use variables instead of registers?\n\n\n44.4.6 Arithmetic\n\nADD (“+”)\nMUL (“*”)\nSUB (“-”)\nDIV (“/”)\nMOD (“%”)\n\n\n\n44.4.7 Bit Arithmetic\n\nAND “&”\nOR “|”\nXOR “^”\nSHL “&lt;&lt;”\nSHR “&gt;&gt;”\nROL “&lt;&lt;&lt;”\nROR “&gt;&gt;&gt;”\nNEG “!”\n\n\n\n44.4.8 Floating Point Unit Support\nAt the moment of this writing, ESIL does not yet support FPU. But you can implement support for unsupported instructions using rz-pipe. Eventually we will get proper support for multimedia and floating point.\n\n\n44.4.9 Handling x86 REP Prefix in ESIL\nESIL specifies that the parsing control-flow commands must be uppercase. Bear in mind that some architectures have uppercase register names. The corresponding register profile should take care not to reuse any of the following:\n3,SKIP   - skip N instructions. used to make relative forward GOTOs\n3,GOTO   - goto instruction 3\nLOOP     - alias for 0,GOTO\nBREAK    - stop evaluating the expression\nSTACK    - dump stack contents to screen\nCLEAR    - clear stack\n\n44.4.9.1 Usage Example:\nrep cmpsb\ncx,!,?{,BREAK,},esi,[1],edi,[1],==,?{,BREAK,},esi,++,edi,++,cx,--,0,GOTO\n\n\n\n44.4.10 Unimplemented/Unhandled Instructions\nThose are expressed with the ‘TODO’ command. They act as a ‘BREAK’, but displays a warning message describing that an instruction is not implemented and will not be emulated. For example:\nfmulp ST(1), ST(0)      =&gt;      TODO,fmulp ST(1),ST(0)\n\n\n44.4.11 ESIL Disassembly Example:\n[0x1000010f8]&gt; e asm.esil=true\n[0x1000010f8]&gt; pd $r @ entry0\n0x1000010f8    55           8,rsp,-=,rbp,rsp,=[8]\n0x1000010f9    4889e5       rsp,rbp,=\n0x1000010fc    4883c768     104,rdi,+=\n0x100001100    4883c668     104,rsi,+=\n0x100001104    5d           rsp,[8],rbp,=,8,rsp,+=\n0x100001105    e950350000   0x465a,rip,= ;[1]\n0x10000110a    55           8,rsp,-=,rbp,rsp,=[8]\n0x10000110b    4889e5       rsp,rbp,=\n0x10000110e    488d4668     rsi,104,+,rax,=\n0x100001112    488d7768     rdi,104,+,rsi,=\n0x100001116    4889c7       rax,rdi,=\n0x100001119    5d           rsp,[8],rbp,=,8,rsp,+=\n0x10000111a    e93b350000   0x465a,rip,= ;[1]\n0x10000111f    55           8,rsp,-=,rbp,rsp,=[8]\n0x100001120    4889e5       rsp,rbp,=\n0x100001123    488b4f60     rdi,96,+,[8],rcx,=\n0x100001127    4c8b4130     rcx,48,+,[8],r8,=\n0x10000112b    488b5660     rsi,96,+,[8],rdx,=\n0x10000112f    b801000000   1,eax,=\n0x100001134    4c394230     rdx,48,+,[8],r8,==,cz,?=\n0x100001138    7f1a         sf,of,!,^,zf,!,&,?{,0x1154,rip,=,} ;[2]\n0x10000113a    7d07         of,!,sf,^,?{,0x1143,rip,} ;[3]\n0x10000113c    b8ffffffff   0xffffffff,eax,= ;  0xffffffff\n0x100001141    eb11         0x1154,rip,= ;[2]\n0x100001143    488b4938     rcx,56,+,[8],rcx,=\n0x100001147    48394a38     rdx,56,+,[8],rcx,==,cz,?=\n\n\n44.4.12 Introspection\nTo ease ESIL parsing we should have a way to express introspection expressions to extract the data that we want. For example, we may want to get the target address of a jump. The parser for ESIL expressions should offer an API to make it possible to extract information by analyzing the expressions easily.\n&gt;  ao~esil,opcode\nopcode: jmp 0x10000465a\nesil: 0x10000465a,rip,=\nWe need a way to retrieve the numeric value of ‘rip’. This is a very simple example, but there are more complex, like conditional ones. We need expressions to be able to get:\n\nopcode type\ndestination of a jump\ncondition depends on\nall regs modified (write)\nall regs accessed (read)\n\n\n\n44.4.13 API HOOKS\nIt is important for emulation to be able to setup hooks in the parser, so we can extend it to implement analysis without having to change it again and again. That is, every time an operation is about to be executed, a user hook is called. It can be used for example to determine if RIP is going to change, or if the instruction updates the stack. Later, we can split that callback into several ones to have an event-based analysis API that may be extended in JavaScript like this:\nesil.on('regset', function(){..\nesil.on('syscall', function(){esil.regset('rip'\nFor the API, see the functions hook_flag_read(), hook_execute() and hook_mem_read(). A callback should return true or 1 if you want to override the action that it takes. For example, to deny memory reads in a region, or voiding memory writes, effectively making it read-only. Return false or 0 if you want to trace ESIL expression parsing.\nOther operations require bindings to external functionalities to work. In this case, rz_ref and rz_io. This must be defined when initializing the ESIL VM.\n\nIo Get/Set\nOut ax, 44\n44,ax,:ou\nSelectors (cs,ds,gs…)\nMov eax, ds:[ebp+8]\nEbp,8,+,:ds,eax,=",

    "text": "46.1 Analyze functions\nCode analysis is a common technique used to extract information from assembly code.\nRizin has different code analysis techniques implemented in the core and available in different commands.\nAs long as the whole functionalities of rizin are available with the API as well as using commands. This gives you the ability to implement your own analysis loops using any programming language, even with rizin one-liners, shellscripts, or analysis or core native plugins.\nThe analysis will show up the internal data structures to identify basic blocks, function trees and to extract opcode-level information.\nThe most common rizin analysis command sequence is aa, which stands for “analyze all”. That all is referring to all symbols and entry-points. If your binary is stripped you will need to use other commands like aaa, aab, aar, aac or so.\nTake some time to understand what each command does and the results after running them to find the best one for your needs.\nIn this example, we analyze the whole file (aa) and then print disassembly of the main() function (pdf). The aa command belongs to the family of auto analysis commands and performs only the most basic auto analysis steps. In rizin there are many different types of auto analysis commands with a different analysis depth, including partial emulation: aa, aaa, aab, aaaa, … There is also a mapping of those commands to the rizin CLI options: rizin -A, rizin -AA, and so on.\nIt is common sense that completely automated analysis can produce non sequitur results, thus rizin provides separate commands for the particular stages of the analysis allowing fine-grained control of the analysis process. Moreover, there is a treasure trove of configuration variables for controlling the analysis outcomes. You can find them in analysis.* and emu.* cfg variables’ namespaces.\nOne of the most important “basic” analysis commands is the set of af subcommands. af means “analyze function”. Using this command you can either allow automatic analysis of the particular function or perform a completely manual one.\nYou can use afl to list the functions found by the analysis.\nThere are a lot of useful commands under afl such as aflj, which lists the function in JSON format and aflm, which lists the functions in the syntax found in makefiles.\nThere’s also afl=, which displays ASCII-art bars with function ranges.\nYou can find the rest of them under afl?.\nSome of the most challenging tasks while performing a function analysis are merge, crop, and resize. As with other analysis commands, you have two modes: semi-automatic and manual. For the semi-automatic, you can use afm &lt;function name&gt; to merge the current function with the one specified by name as an argument, aff to readjust the function after analysis changes or function edits, afu &lt;address&gt; to do the resize and analysis of the current function until the specified address.\nApart from those semi-automatic ways to edit/analyze the function, you can handcraft it in the manual mode with af+ command and edit basic blocks of it using afb commands. Before changing the basic blocks of the function it is recommended to check the already presented ones:",

    "text": "46.2 Recursive analysis\nThere are 5 important program-wide half-automated analysis commands:\n\naab - perform basic-block analysis (“Nucleus” algorithm)\naac - analyze function calls from one (selected or current function)\naaf - analyze all function calls\naar - analyze data references\naad - analyze pointers to pointers references\n\nThose are only generic semi-automated reference searching algorithms. Rizin provides a wide choice of manual references’ creation of any kind. For this fine-grained control, you can use ax commands.\nUsage: ax[?d-l*]   # see also 'afx?'\n| ax              list refs\n| ax*             output rizin commands\n| ax addr [at]    add code ref pointing to addr (from curseek)\n| ax- [at]        clean all refs/refs from addr\n| ax-*            clean all refs/refs\n| axc addr [at]   add generic code ref\n| axC addr [at]   add code call ref\n| axg [addr]      show xrefs graph to reach current function\n| axg* [addr]     show xrefs graph to given address, use .axg*;aggv\n| axgj [addr]     show xrefs graph to reach current function in json format\n| axd addr [at]   add data ref\n| axq             list refs in quiet/human-readable format\n| axj             list refs in json format\n| axF [flg-glob]  find data/code references of flags\n| axm addr [at]   copy data/code references pointing to addr to also point to curseek (or at)\n| axt [addr]      find data/code references to this address\n| axf [addr]      find data/code references from this address\n| axv [addr]      list local variables read-write-exec references\n| ax. [addr]      find data/code references from and to this address\n| axff[j] [addr]  find data/code references from this function\n| axs addr [at]   add string ref\nThe most commonly used ax commands are axt and axf, especially as a part of various rz-pipe scripts. Let’s say we see the string in the data or a code section and want to find all places it was referenced from, we should use axt:\n[0x0001783a]&gt; pd 2\n;-- str.02x:\n; STRING XREF from 0x00005de0 (sub.strlen_d50)\n; CODE XREF from 0x00017838 (str.._s_s_s + 7)\n0x0001783a     .string \"%%%02x\" ; len=7\n;-- str.src_ls.c:\n; STRING XREF from 0x0000541b (sub.free_b04)\n; STRING XREF from 0x0000543a (sub.__assert_fail_41f + 27)\n; STRING XREF from 0x00005459 (sub.__assert_fail_41f + 58)\n; STRING XREF from 0x00005f9e (sub._setjmp_e30)\n; CODE XREF from 0x0001783f (str.02x + 5)\n0x00017841 .string \"src/ls.c\" ; len=9\n[0x0001783a]&gt; axt\nsub.strlen_d50 0x5de0 [STRING] lea rcx, str.02x\n(nofunc) 0x17838 [CODE] jae str.02x\nThere are also some useful commands under axt. Use axtg to generate rizin commands which will help you to create graphs according to the XREFs.\n[0x08048320]&gt; s main\n[0x080483e0]&gt; axtg\nagn 0x8048337 \"entry0 + 23\"\nagn 0x80483e0 \"main\"\nage 0x8048337 0x80483e0\nUse axt* to split the rizin commands and set flags on those corresponding XREFs.\nAlso under ax is axg, which finds the path between two points in the file by showing an XREFs graph to reach the location or function. For example:\n:&gt; axg sym.imp.printf\n- 0x08048a5c fcn 0x08048a5c sym.imp.printf\n  - 0x080483e5 fcn 0x080483e0 main\n  - 0x080483e0 fcn 0x080483e0 main\n    - 0x08048337 fcn 0x08048320 entry0\n  - 0x08048425 fcn 0x080483e0 main\nUse axg* to generate rizin commands which will help you to create graphs using agn and age commands, according to the XREFs.\nApart from predefined algorithms to identify functions there is a way to specify a function prelude with a configuration option analysis.prelude. For example, like e analysis.prelude=0x554889e5 which means\npush rbp\nmov rbp, rsp\non x86_64 platform. It should be specified before any analysis commands.",

    "title": "46  Code Analysis",
    "section": "46.3 Configuration",
    "text": "46.3 Configuration\nRizin allows changing the behavior of almost any analysis stages or commands. There are different kinds of configuration options:\n\nFlow control\nBasic blocks control\nReferences control\nIO/Ranges\nJump tables analysis control\nPlatform/target-specific options\n\n\n46.3.1 Control flow configuration\nThe two most commonly used options for changing the behavior of control flow analysis in rizin are analysis.hasnext and analysis.jmp.after. The first one allows forcing rizin to continue the analysis after the end of the function, even if the next chunk of the code wasn’t called anywhere, thus analyzing all of the available functions. The latter one allows forcing rizin to continue the analysis even after unconditional jumps.\nIn addition to those we can also set analysis.jmp.indir to follow the indirect jumps, continuing analysis; analysis.pushret to analyze push ...; ret sequence as a jump; analysis.nopskip to skip the NOP sequences at a function beginning.\nFor now, rizin also allows you to change the maximum basic block size with analysis.bb.maxsize option . The default value just works in most use cases, but it’s useful to increase that for example when dealing with obfuscated code. Beware that some of the basic block control options may disappear in the future in favor of more automated ways to set those.\nFor some unusual binaries or targets, there is an option analysis.noncode. Rizin doesn’t try to analyze data sections as a code by default. But in some cases - malware, packed binaries, binaries for embedded systems, it is often a case. Thus - this option.\n\n\n46.3.2 Reference control\nThe most crucial options that change the analysis results drastically. Sometimes some can be disabled to save time and memory when analyzing big binaries.\n\nanalysis.jmp.ref - to allow references creation for unconditional jumps\nanalysis.jmp.cref - same, but for conditional jumps\nanalysis.datarefs - to follow the data references in code\nanalysis.refstr - search for strings in data references\nanalysis.strings - search for strings and creating references\n\nNote that strings references control is disabled by default because it increases the analysis time.\n\n\n46.3.3 Analysis ranges\nThere are a few options for this:\n\nanalysis.limits - enables the range limits for analysis operations\nanalysis.from - starting address of the limit range\nanalysis.to - the corresponding end of the limit range\nanalysis.in - specify search boundaries for analysis. You can set it to io.maps, io.sections.exec, dbg.maps and many more. For example:\n\nTo analyze a specific memory map with analysis.from and analysis.to, set analysis.in = dbg.maps.\nTo analyze in the boundaries set by analysis.from and analysis.to, set analysis.in=range.\nTo analyze in the current mapped segment or section, you can put analysis.in=bin.segment or analysis.in=bin.section, respectively.\nTo analyze in the current memory map, specify analysis.in=dbg.map.\nTo analyze in the stack or heap, you can set analysis.in=dbg.stack or analysis.in=dbg.heap.\nTo analyze in the current function or basic block, you can specify analysis.in=analysis.fcn or analysis.in=analysis.bb.\n\n\nPlease see e analysis.in=?? for the complete list.\n\n\n46.3.4 Jump tables\nJump tables are one of the trickiest targets in binary reverse engineering. There are hundreds of different types, the end result depending on the compiler/linker and LTO stages of optimization. Thus rizin allows enabling some experimental jump tables detection algorithms using analysis.jmp.tbl option. Eventually, algorithms moved into the default analysis loops once they start to work on every supported platform/target/test-case. Two more options can affect the jump tables analysis results too:\n\nanalysis.jmp.indir - follow the indirect jumps, some jump tables rely on them\nanalysis.datarefs - follow the data references, some jump tables use those\n\n\n\n46.3.5 Platform specific controls\nThere are two common problems when analyzing embedded targets: ARM/Thumb detection and MIPS GP value. In the case of ARM binaries rizin supports some auto-detection of ARM/Thumb mode switches, but beware that it uses partial ESIL emulation, thus slowing the analysis process. If you will not like the results, particular functions’ mode can be overridden with afB command.\nThe MIPS GP problem is even trickier. It is basic knowledge that GP value can be different not only for the whole program but also for some functions. To partially solve that there are options analysis.gp and analysis.gpfixed. The first one sets the GP value for the whole program or particular function. The latter allows to “constantify” the GP value if some code is willing to change its value, always resetting it if the case. Those are heavily experimental and might be changed in the future in favor of more automated analysis.",

To get into the minimap mode type VV then press p twice:\n\n\n\nvv2\n\n\nThis mode allows you to see the disassembly of each node separately, just navigate between them using the Tab key.",

    "text": "47.1 Type inference\nRizin allows managing local variables, no matter their location, stack or registers. The variables’ auto analysis is enabled by default but can be disabled with analysis.vars configuration option.\nThe main variables commands are located in afv namespace:\nafvr, afvb and afvs commands are uniform but allow manipulation of register-based arguments and variables, BP/FP-based arguments and variables, and SP-based arguments and variables respectively. If we check the help for afvr we will get the way two others commands works too:\nLike many other things variables detection is performed by rizin automatically, but results can be changed with those arguments/variables control commands. This kind of analysis relies heavily on preloaded function prototypes and the calling-convention, thus loading symbols can improve it. Moreover, after changing something we can rerun variables analysis with afva command. Quite often variables analysis is accompanied with types analysis, see afta command.\nThe most important aspect of reverse engineering - naming things. Of course, you can rename a variable too, affecting all places it was referenced. This can be achieved with afvn for any type of argument or variable. Or you can simply remove the variable or argument with afv- command.\nAs mentioned before the analysis loop relies heavily on types information while performing variables analysis stages. Thus comes next very important command - afvt, which allows you to change the type of variable:\nLess commonly used feature, which is still under heavy development - distinction between variables being read and written. You can list those being read with afvR command and those being written with afvW command. Both commands provide a list of the places those operations are performed:\nThe type inference for local variables and arguments is well integrated with the command afta.\nLet’s see an example of this with a simple hello_world binary\nIt also extracts type information from format strings like printf (\"fmt : %s , %u , %d\", ...), the format specifications are extracted from analysis/d/spec.sdb\nYou could create a new profile for specifying a set of format chars depending on different libraries/operating systems/programming languages like this :\nThen change your default specification to a newly created one using this config variable e analysis.spec=win\nFor more information about primitive and user-defined types support in rizin refer to types chapter.",

    "text": "Rizin supports C-syntax data type definitions. Most of the related commands are located in t namespace:\n[0x000051c0]&gt; t?\nUsage: t[?]   # Types, noreturn, signatures, C parser and more\n| t[j*] [&lt;type&gt;] # List all types / Show type information\n| t- &lt;type&gt;      # Remove the type\n| t-*            # Remove all types\n| tc[dc]         # List loaded types in C format\n| td &lt;type&gt;      # Define type from C definition\n| te[jbcdf]      # List loaded enums\n| tf[j-c?]       # List loaded functions definitions\n| tn[j-?]        # Manage noreturn function attributes and marks\n| to[es]         # Open C header file and load types from it\n| tp[vx]         # Print formatted type casted to the address\n| ts[jlcd]       # List loaded structures\n| tt[jc]         # List loaded typedefs\n| tu[jlcd]       # List loaded unions\n| tx[fgl]        # Type xrefs\nNote that the basic (atomic) types are not those from the C standard - not char, _Bool, or short. Because those types can be different from one platform to another, rizin uses definite types like as int8_t or uint64_t and will convert int to int32_t or int64_t depending on the binary or debuggee platform/compiler.\nBasic types can be listed using the t command. For structured types, you can use ts, tu, or te for structs, unions, and enums, respectively:\n[0x000051c0]&gt; t\nchar\nchar *\nint\nint16_t\nint32_t\nint64_t\nint8_t\nlong\nlong long\n...\n\n48.0.1 Loading types\nThere are three easy ways to define a new type: * Passing a string to the td command * Passing a file with the to &lt;filename&gt; command * Using your defined cfg.editor by calling the the to - command\n[0x000051c0]&gt; td \"struct foo {char* a; int b;}\"\n[0x000051c0]&gt; cat ~/rizin-regressions/bins/headers/s3.h\nstruct S1 {\n    int x[3];\n    int y[4];\n    int z;\n};\n[0x000051c0]&gt; to ~/rizin-regressions/bins/headers/s3.h\n[0x000051c0]&gt; ts\nfoo\nS1\nAlso, note there is a config option to specify include directories for types parsing\n[0x00000000]&gt; el~dir.type\ndir.types: Default path to look for cparse type files\n[0x00000000]&gt; e dir.types\n/usr/include\n\n\n48.0.2 Printing types\nNotice below we have used ts command, which basically converts the C type description into the sequence of pf commands. See more about print format.\nThe tp command uses the pf string to print all the members of type at the current offset/given address:\n[0x000051c0]&gt; ts foo\npf zd a b\n[0x000051c0]&gt; tp foo\n a : 0x000051c0 = 'hello'\n b : 0x000051cc = 10\n[0x000051c0]&gt; tp foo 0x000053c0\n a : 0x000053c0 = 'world'\n b : 0x000053cc = 20\nAlso, you could fill your own data into the struct and print it using tpx command\n[0x000051c0]&gt; tpx foo 4141414144141414141442001000000\n a : 0x000051c0 = AAAAD.....B\n b : 0x000051cc = 16\n\n\n48.0.3 Linking Types\nThe tp command only performs a temporary cast. We can use the avga command to define a global variable of a specified type, which is linked to an address.\n[0x000051c0]&gt; avga struct_1 S1 @ 0x51cf\n[0x000051c0]&gt; avg\nglobal struct S1 struct_1 @ 0x000051cf\nMoreover, the link will be shown in the disassembly output or visual mode:\n[0x000051c0 15% 300 /bin/ls]&gt; pd $r @ entry0\n ;-- entry0:\n 0x000051c0      xor ebp, ebp\n 0x000051c2      mov r9, rdx\n 0x000051c5      pop rsi\n 0x000051c6      mov rdx, rsp\n 0x000051c9      and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0\n 0x000051cd      push rax\n 0x000051ce      push rsp\n(S1 struct_1)\n x : 0x000051cf = [ 2315619660, 1207959810, 34803085 ]\n y : 0x000051db = [ 2370306049, 4293315645, 3860201471, 4093649307 ]\n z : 0x000051eb = 4464399\n 0x000051f0      lea rdi, loc._edata         ; 0x21f248\n 0x000051f7      push rbp\n 0x000051f8      lea rax, loc._edata         ; 0x21f248\n 0x000051ff      cmp rax, rdi\n 0x00005202      mov rbp, rsp\nOnce the struct is linked, rizin tries to propagate structure offset in the function at the current offset, to run this analysis on the whole program or at any targeted functions after all structs are linked you have aat command:\n[0x00000000]&gt; aa?\n| aat [&lt;func_name&gt;] # Analyze all/given function to convert immediate to linked structure offsets\nNote sometimes the emulation may not be accurate, for example as below :\n|0x000006da  push rbp\n|0x000006db  mov rbp, rsp\n|0x000006de  sub rsp, 0x10\n|0x000006e2  mov edi, 0x20               ; \"@\"\n|0x000006e7  call sym.imp.malloc         ;  void *malloc(size_t size)\n|0x000006ec  mov qword [local_8h], rax\n|0x000006f0  mov rax, qword [local_8h]\n\nThe return value of malloc may differ between two emulations, so you have to set the hint for return value manually using ahr command, so run tl or aat command after setting up the return value hint.\n[0x000006da]&gt; ah?\n| ahr &lt;return&gt;         # Set function return value hint\n\n\n48.0.4 Structure Immediates\nThere is one more important aspect of using types in rizin - using aht you can change the immediate in the opcode to the structure offset. Let’s see a simple example of [R]SI-relative addressing\n[0x000052f0]&gt; pd 1\n0x000052f0      mov rax, qword [rsi + 8]    ; [0x8:8]=0\nHere 8 - is some offset in the memory, where rsi probably holds some structure pointer. Imagine that we have the following structures\n\n[0x000052f0]&gt; td \"struct ms { char b[8]; int member1; int member2; };\"\n[0x000052f0]&gt; td \"struct ms1 { uint64_t a; int member1; };\"\n[0x000052f0]&gt; td \"struct ms2 { uint16_t a; int64_t b; int member1; };\"\nNow we need to set the proper structure member offset instead of 8 in this instruction. At first, we need to list available types matching this offset:\n[0x000052f0]&gt; ahts 8\nms.member1\nms1.member1\nNote, that ms2 is not listed, because it has no members with offset 8. After listing available options we can link it to the chosen offset at the current address:\n[0x000052f0]&gt; aht ms1.member1\n[0x000052f0]&gt; pd 1\n0x000052f0      488b4608       mov rax, qword [rsi + ms1.member1]    ; [0x8:8]=0\n\n\n48.0.5 Managing enums\n\nPrinting all fields in enum using te command\n\n[0x00000000]&gt; td \"enum Foo {COW=1,BAR=2};\"\n[0x00000000]&gt; te Foo\nCOW = 0x1\nBAR = 0x2\n\nFinding matching enum member for given bitfield and vice-versa\n\n[0x00000000]&gt; te Foo 0x1\nCOW\n[0x00000000]&gt; teb Foo COW\n0x1",

Currently, the support is very basic, allowing you only to inspect parsed tables.\n|Usage: av[?jr*] C++ vtables and RTTI\n| av           search for vtables in data sections and show results\n| avj          like av, but as json\n| av*          like av, but as rizin commands\n| avr[j@addr]  try to parse RTTI at vtable addr (see analysis.cpp.abi)\n| avra[j]      search for vtables and try to parse RTTI at each of them\nThe main commands here are av and avr. av lists all virtual tables found when rizin opened the file. If you are not happy with the result you may want to try to parse a virtual table at a particular address with avr command. avra performs the search and parsing of all virtual tables in the binary, like rizin does during the file opening.",

    "text": "52.1 Emulation in analysis loop\nOne of the most important things to remember in reverse engineering is the core difference between static analysis and dynamic analysis. As many already know, static analysis suffers from the path explosion problem, which is impossible to solve even in the most basic way without at least a partial emulation.\nThus many professional reverse engineering tools use code emulation while performing an analysis of binary code, and rizin is no different here.\nFor partial emulation (or imprecise full emulation) rizin uses its own ESIL intermediate language and virtual machine.\nRizin supports this kind of partial emulation for all platforms that implement ESIL uplifting (x86/x86_64, ARM, arm64, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC, AVR, 8051, Gameboy, …).\nOne of the most common usages of such emulation is to calculate indirect jumps and conditional jumps.\nTo see the ESIL representation of the program one can use the ao command or enable the asm.esil configuration variable, to check if the program uplifted correctly, and to grasp how ESIL works:\nTo manually setup the ESIL imprecise emulation you need to run this command sequence:\nWhile performing emulation, please remember, that ESIL VM cannot emulate external calls or system calls, along with SIMD instructions. Thus the most common scenario is to emulate only a small chunk of the code, like encryption/decryption, unpacking or calculating something.\nAfter we successfully set up the ESIL VM we can interact with it like with a usual debugging mode. The commands interface for ESIL VM is almost identical to the debugging one:\nIn visual mode, all of the debugging hotkeys will work also in ESIL emulation mode.\nAlong with usual emulation, there is a possibility to record and replay mode:\nMore about this operation mode you can read in Reverse Debugging chapter.\nApart from the manual emulation mode, it can be used automatically in the analysis loop. For example, the aaaa command performs the ESIL emulation stage along with others. To disable or enable its usage you can use analysis.esil configuration variable. There is one more important option, though setting it might be quite dangerous, especially in the case of malware - emu.write which allows ESIL VM to modify memory. Sometimes it is required though, especially in the process of deobfuscating or unpacking code.\nTo show the process of emulation you can set asm.emu variable, which will show calculated register and memory values in disassembly comments:\nNote here likely comments, which indicates that ESIL emulation predicted for particular conditional jump to happen.\nApart from the basic ESIL VM setup, you can change the behavior with other options located in emu. and esil. configuration namespaces.\nFor manipulating ESIL working with memory and stack you can use the following options:",

    "text": "Rizin automatically parses available imports and exports sections in the binary, moreover, it can load additional debugging information if present. Two main formats are supported: DWARF and PDB (for Windows binaries). Note that, unlike many tools rizin doesn’t rely on Windows API to parse PDB files, thus they can be loaded on any other supported platform - e.g. Linux or OS X.\nDWARF debug info loads automatically by default because usually it’s stored right in the executable file. PDB is a bit of a different beast - it is always stored as a separate binary, thus the different logic of handling it.\nAt first, one of the common scenarios is to analyze the file from Windows distribution. In this case, all PDB files are available on the Microsoft server, which is by default is in options. See all pdb options in rizin:\npdb.autoload = 0\npdb.extract = 1\npdb.server = https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\npdb.useragent = Microsoft-Symbol-Server/6.11.0001.402\nUsing the variable pdb.server you can change the address where rizin will try to download the PDB file by the GUID stored in the executable header. You can make use of multiple symbol servers by separating each URL with a semi-colon:\ne pdb.server=https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;https://symbols.mozilla.org/\nOn Windows, you can also use local network share paths (UNC paths) as symbol servers.\nUsually, there is no reason to change the default pdb.useragent, but who knows where could it be handy?\nBecause those PDB files are stored as “cab” archives on the server, pdb.extract=1 says to automatically extract them.\nNote that for the automatic downloading to work you need the “cabextract” tool, and wget/curl installed.\nSometimes you don’t need to do that from the rizin itself, thus - two handy rz-bin options:\n -P              show debug/pdb information\n -PP             download pdb file for binary\nwhere -PP automatically downloads the pdb for the selected binary, using those pdb.* config options. -P will dump the contents of the PDB file, which is useful sometimes for a quick understanding of the symbols stored in it.\nApart from the basic scenario of just opening a file, PDB information can be additionally manipulated by the id commands:\n[0x000051c0]&gt; id?\n|Usage: id Debug information\n| Output mode:\n| '*'              Output in rizin commands\n| id               Source lines\n| idp [file.pdb]   Load pdb file information\n| idpi [file.pdb]  Show pdb file information\n| idpd             Download pdb file on remote server\nWhere idpi is basically the same as rz-bin -P. Note that idp can be also used not only in the static analysis mode but also in the debugging mode, even if connected via WinDbg.\nFor simplifying the loading PDBs, especially for the processes with many linked DLLs, rizin can autoload all required PDBs automatically - you need just set the e pdb.autoload=true option. Then if you load some file in debugging mode in Windows, using rizin -d file.exe or rizin -d 2345 (attach to pid 2345), all related PDB files will be loaded automatically.\nDWARF information loading, on the other hand, is completely automated. You don’t need to run any commands/change any options:\nrizin `which rz-bin`\n[0x00002437 8% 300 /usr/local/bin/rz-bin]&gt; pd $r\n0x00002437  jne 0x2468                  ;[1]\n0x00002439  cmp qword reloc.__cxa_finalize_224, 0\n0x00002441  push rbp\n0x00002442  mov rbp, rsp\n0x00002445  je 0x2453                   ;[2]\n0x00002447  lea rdi, obj.__dso_handle   ; 0x207c40 ; \"@| \"\n0x0000244e  call 0x2360                 ;[3]\n0x00002453  call sym.deregister_tm_clones ;[4]\n0x00002458  mov byte [obj.completed.6991], 1 ; obj.__TMC_END__ ; [0x2082f0:1]=0\n0x0000245f  pop rbp\n0x00002460  ret\n0x00002461  nop dword [rax]\n0x00002468  ret\n0x0000246a  nop word [rax + rax]\n;-- entry1.init:\n;-- frame_dummy:\n0x00002470  push rbp\n0x00002471  mov rbp, rsp\n0x00002474  pop rbp\n0x00002475  jmp sym.register_tm_clones  ;[5]\n;-- blob_version:\n0x0000247a  push rbp                    ; ../blob/version.c:18\n0x0000247b  mov rbp, rsp\n0x0000247e  sub rsp, 0x10\n0x00002482  mov qword [rbp - 8], rdi\n0x00002486  mov eax, 0x32               ; ../blob/version.c:24 ; '2'\n0x0000248b  test al, al                 ; ../blob/version.c:19\n0x0000248d  je 0x2498                   ;[6]\n0x0000248f  lea rax, str.2.0.1_182_gf1aa3aa4d ; 0x60b8 ; \"2.0.1-182-gf1aa3aa4d\"\n0x00002496  jmp 0x249f                  ;[7]\n0x00002498  lea rax, 0x000060cd\n0x0000249f  mov rsi, qword [rbp - 8]\n0x000024a3  mov r8, rax\n0x000024a6  mov ecx, 0x40               ; section_end.ehdr\n0x000024ab  mov edx, 0x40c0\n0x000024b0  lea rdi, str._s_2.1.0_git__d___linux_x86__d_git._s_n ; 0x60d0 ; \"%s 2.1.0-git %d @ linux-x86-%d git.%s\\n\"\n0x000024b7  mov eax, 0\n0x000024bc  call 0x2350                 ;[8]\n0x000024c1  mov eax, 0x66               ; ../blob/version.c:25 ; 'f'\n0x000024c6  test al, al\n0x000024c8  je 0x24d6                   ;[9]\n0x000024ca  lea rdi, str.commit:_f1aa3aa4d2599c1ad60e3ecbe5f4d8261b282385_build:_2017_11_06__12:18:39 ; ../blob/version.c:26 ; 0x60f8 ; \"commit: f1aa3aa4d2599c1ad60e3ecbe5f4d8261b282385 build: 2017-11-06__1\n0x000024d1  call sym.imp.puts           ;[?]\n0x000024d6  mov eax, 0                  ; ../blob/version.c:28\n0x000024db  leave                       ; ../blob/version.c:29\n0x000024dc  ret\n;-- rabin_show_help:\n0x000024dd  push rbp                    ; .//rz-bin.c:27\nAs you can see, it loads function names and source line information.",

The commands to construct the graph are agn [title] [body] to add a node and age [title1] [title2] to add an edge. The [body] field can be expressed in base64 to include special formatting (such as newlines).\nTo easily execute the printed commands, it is possible to prepend a dot to the command (.agf*).\n\n\n55.0.9 Web / image (e.g. agfw)\nRizin will convert the graph to dot format, use the dot program to convert it to a .gif image and then try to find an already installed viewer on your system (xdg-open, open, …) and display the graph there.\nThe extension of the output image can be set with the graph.extension config variable. Available extensions are png, jpg, gif, pdf, ps.\nNote: for particularly large graphs, the most recommended extension is svg as it will produce images of much smaller size\nIf graph.web config variable is enabled, rizin will try to display the graph using the browser (this feature is experimental and unfinished, and disabled by default.)",

CPUs and development boards differ by minor and sometimes large differences in their design, ports, MMIO registers and other peripherals. Rizin handles these differences by storing the data regarding each CPUs and platforms in SDB files in a standard format, instead of hardcoding them with each of the disassembler plugins. This information will be parsed and added as flags and comments during the analysis loop and will show up in the disassembly and other places, making reverse engineering on those particular chips ets is much easier. This also helps in easy addition of a new port, in maintenance and in user-friendliness.",

    "section": "56.2 How it works",
    "text": "56.2 How it works\n\n56.2.1 CPU profiles\nAll the specifics pertaining to a CPU is written down in a CPU profile. It is designed in a way that allows you to enter CPU specefic values like: size of the RAM (RAM_SIZE), size of the ROM (ROM_SIZE) and many more. CPU profiles can be selected using the configuration variable asm.cpu. Firstly, Rizin checks whether the a CPU profile exists for the selected CPU and architecture. If it exists, Rizin generates the filepath of the profile and gets to a stage where it’s ready to be loaded up. During analysis (aa), it’s loaded up and the values are parsed and handled. CPU profiles also allow you to add information regarding the IO and extended IO registers of a CPU. The information pertaining to the IO and extended IO registers are added as flags at their corresponding offsets.\nThe CPU profile of AVR’s ATTiny88 CPU looks like this:\nRAM_SIZE=512\nROM_SIZE=8192\nINTERRUPT_VECTOR_SIZE=2\n\nPINB=io\nPINB.address=0x03\nDDRB=io\nDDRB.address=0x04\nPORTB=io\nHere, PINB is the name and io is the type of the port and this will be added as a flag at the offset 0x03. The type can be ext_io if it’s an extended IO register, as well. Both will be added as flags and the only difference between them is that they will be added in different flagspaces.\nCPU profiles also support mapping the ROM. According the ROM_ADDRESS and ROM_SIZE, a section named .rom will be added during analysis.\n\n56.2.1.1 Adding CPU profiles\nCPU profiles are stored in SDB files under the directory lirbz/asm/cpus and that’s where you will have to put your new profile. The files follow a naming convention like arch-cpu. You can see the complete list of things that are parsed at librz/analysis/arch_profile.c and if necessary, a new key can be easily added.\nTo add a new CPU profile, firstly make sure that you have the name of the CPU defined in the list of CPUs defined by the variable cpus in the corresponding architecture’s disassembler plugin (RzAsmPlugin). Then, simply add the SDB file in the directory, add the entry in the meson.build of the same directory and build again. Choose the right CPU and architecture and analyze again (aa) to load up the CPU profile.\nFor reference, you can see the previously added CPU profile of ATmega16 here: librz/asm/cpus/avr-ATmega16.sdb.txt.\n\n\n\n56.2.2 Platform profiles\nPlatform profiles are designed with an idea to support adding information that is pertaining to a specific board or a micro controller. For example, most of the Raspberry Pi-s use a specific Broadcom chip and its peripherals like registers and interrupts will be the same for all Raspberry Pi-s. These profiles can be selected using the configuration variable asm.platforms and is loaded during analysis (aa). If you run e asm.platform=?, you can see the supported platforms by the selected architecture and CPU.\nLet’s have a look at Broadcom 2835’s platform profile:\nAUX_IRQ=name\nAUX_IRQ.address=0x7e215000\nAUX_IRQ.comment=Auxiliary Interrupt status\n\nAUX_MU_IO_REG=name\nAUX_MU_IO_REG.address=0x7e215040\nAUX_MU_IO_REG.comment=Mini UART I/O Data\nJust like in CPU profiles, the name will be added as a flag and the comment as a comment (CCu).\n\n56.2.2.1 Adding platform profiles\nPlatform profiles are stored in librz/asm/platforms/ and that’s where you will have to put your profile. They follow a naming convention like arch-cpu-platform.\nTo add a new platform profile, we will have to define the name of the platform in the variable platforms in the RzAsmPlugin definition corresponding architecture’s disassembler plugin. You will also need to add the CPU is it’s not already added. Then, add the entry in the meson.build of the same directory and build again. Choose the right CPU, architecture and platform and analyze again (aa).\nYou can also check out the platform profiles that were previously added at librz/asm/platforms/arm-arm1176-bcm2835.sdb.txt.",

    "text": "Rizin provides a wide set of a features to automate boring work. It ranges from the simple sequencing of the commands to the calling scripts/another programs via IPC (Inter-Process Communication), called rz-pipe.\nAs mentioned a few times before there is an ability to sequence commands using ; semicolon operator.\n[0x00404800]&gt; pd 1 ; ao 1\n           0x00404800      b827e66100     mov eax, 0x61e627      ; \"tab\"\naddress: 0x404800\nopcode: mov eax, 0x61e627\nprefix: 0\nbytes: b827e66100\nptr: 0x0061e627\nrefptr: 0\nsize: 5\ntype: mov\nesil: 6415911,rax,=\nstack: null\nfamily: cpu\n[0x00404800]&gt;\nIt simply runs the second command after finishing the first one, like in a shell.\nThe second important way to sequence the commands is with a simple pipe |\nao|grep address\nNote, the | pipe only can pipe output of rizin commands to external (shell) commands, like system programs or builtin shell commands. There is a similar way to sequence rizin commands, using the backtick operator `command`. The quoted part will undergo command substitution and the output will be used as an argument of the command line.\nFor example, we want to see a few bytes of the memory at the address referred to by the ‘mov eax, addr’ instruction. We can do that without jumping to it, using a sequence of commands:\n[0x00404800]&gt; pd 1\n              0x00404800      b827e66100     mov eax, 0x61e627      ; \"tab\"\n[0x00404800]&gt; ao\naddress: 0x404800\nopcode: mov eax, 0x61e627\nprefix: 0\nbytes: b827e66100\nptr: 0x0061e627\nrefptr: 0\nsize: 5\ntype: mov\nesil: 6415911,rax,=\nstack: null\nfamily: cpu\n[0x00404800]&gt; ao~ptr[1]\n0x0061e627\n0\n[0x00404800]&gt; px 10 @ `ao~ptr[1]`\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x0061e627  7461 6200 2e69 6e74 6572                 tab..inter\n[0x00404800]&gt;\nAnd of course it’s possible to redirect the output of an rizin command into a file, using the &gt; and &gt;&gt; commands\n[0x00404800]&gt; px 10 @ `ao~ptr[1]` &gt; example.txt\n[0x00404800]&gt; px 10 @ `ao~ptr[1]` &gt;&gt; example.txt\nThe %$? command describes several helpful variables you can use to do similar actions even more easily, like the $v “immediate value” variable, or the $m opcode memory reference variable.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most common task in automation is looping through something, there are multiple ways to do this in rizin. You can find all these loops under @@?.\nWe can loop over flags:\n@@f:flagname-regex\nFor example, we want to see function information with afi command:\n[0x004047d6]&gt; afi\n#\noffset: 0x004047d0\nname: entry0\nsize: 42\nrealsz: 42\nstackframe: 0\ncall-convention: amd64\ncyclomatic-complexity: 1\nbits: 64\ntype: fcn [NEW]\nnum-bbs: 1\nedges: 0\nend-bbs: 1\ncall-refs: 0x00402450 C\ndata-refs: 0x004136c0 0x00413660 0x004027e0\ncode-xrefs:\ndata-xrefs:\nlocals:0\nargs: 0\ndiff: type: new\n[0x004047d6]&gt;\nNow let’s say, for example, that we’d like see a particular field from this output for all functions found by analysis. We can do that with a loop over all function flags (whose names begin with fcn.):\n[0x004047d6]&gt; fs functions\n[0x004047d6]&gt; afi @@f:fcn.* ~name\nThis command will extract the name field from the afi output of every flag with a name matching the regexp fcn.*. There are also other loops, for example one called @@F runs your command on every functions found by rizin:\n[0x004047d6]&gt; afi @@F ~name\nWe can also loop over a list of offsets, using the following syntax:\n@@=1 2 3 ... N\nFor example, say we want to see the opcode information for 2 offsets: the current one, and at current + 2:\n[0x004047d6]&gt; ao @@=$$ $$+2\naddress: 0x4047d6\nopcode: mov rdx, rsp\nprefix: 0\nbytes: 4889e2\nrefptr: 0\nsize: 3\ntype: mov\nesil: rsp,rdx,=\nstack: null\nfamily: cpu\naddress: 0x4047d8\nopcode: loop 0x404822\nprefix: 0\nbytes: e248\nrefptr: 0\nsize: 2\ntype: cjmp\nesil: 1,rcx,-=,rcx,?{,4212770,rip,=,}\njump: 0x00404822\nfail: 0x004047da\nstack: null\ncond: al\nfamily: cpu\n[0x004047d6]&gt;\nNote we’re using the $$ variable which evaluates to the current offset. Also note that $$+2 is evaluated before looping, so we can use the simple arithmetic expressions.\nA third way to loop is by having the offsets be loaded from a file. This file should contain one offset per line.\n[0x004047d0]&gt; ?v $$ &gt; offsets.txt\n[0x004047d0]&gt; ?v $$+2 &gt;&gt; offsets.txt\n[0x004047d0]&gt; !cat offsets.txt\n4047d0\n4047d2\n[0x004047d0]&gt; pi 1 @@.offsets.txt\nxor ebp, ebp\nmov r9, rdx\nIf you want to iterate over all instructions of a basic block, you can do:\n[0x004047d0]&gt; pi 1 @@i\nendbr64\npush rbx\ntest rdi, rdi\nje 0x14635\nIn this example the command pi 1 runs over all the instructions in the current basic block.\nIf you want to iterate over all instructions of all basic blocks of the current function, you can do:\n[0x004047d0]&gt; pi 1 @@i @@b\nendbr64     \npush rbx            \ntest rdi, rdi\nje 0x14635\nmov esi, 0x2f    \nmov rbx, rdi\n[... cut for example ...]\nmov rbx, r8                                                                                    \njmp 0x1461a         \nmov rax, qword [reloc.stderr]\nmov edx, 0x37     \nmov esi, 1            \nlea rdi, str.A_NULL_argv_0__was_passed_through_an_exec_system_call.                            \nmov rcx, qword [rax]\ncall sym.imp.fwrite\ncall sym.imp.abort\nOr if you want to make the split between basic blocks clearer:\n[0x004047d0]&gt; (_;pi 1 @@i; ?e)() @@b\nendbr64     \npush rbx            \ntest rdi, rdi\nje 0x14635\n\nmov esi, 0x2f    \nmov rbx, rdi\n[... cut for example ...]\nmov rbx, r8                                                                                    \njmp 0x1461a         \n\nmov rax, qword [reloc.stderr]\nmov edx, 0x37     \nmov esi, 1            \nlea rdi, str.A_NULL_argv_0__was_passed_through_an_exec_system_call.                            \nmov rcx, qword [rax]\ncall sym.imp.fwrite\ncall sym.imp.abort",

    "text": "Debuggers are implemented as IO plugins. Therefore, rizin can handle different URI types for spawning, attaching and controlling processes. The complete list of IO plugins can be viewed with rizin -L. Those that have “d” in the first column (“rwd”) support debugging. For example:\nr_d  debug       Debug a program or pid. dbg:///bin/ls, dbg://1388 (LGPL3)\nrwd  gdb         Attach to gdbserver, 'qemu -s', gdb://localhost:1234 (LGPL3)\nThere are different backends for many target architectures and operating systems, e.g., GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS X, (Net,Free,Open)BSD and Solaris.\nProcess memory is treated as a plain file. All mapped memory pages of a debugged program and its libraries can be read and interpreted as code or data structures.\nCommunication between rizin and the debugger IO layer is wrapped into system() calls, which accept a string as an argument, and executes it as a command. An answer is then buffered in the output console, its contents can be additionally processed by a script. Access to the IO system is achieved with R!. Most IO plugins provide help with R!? or R!help. For example:\n$ rizin -d /bin/ls\n...\n[0x7fc15afa3cc0]&gt; R!help\nUsage: R!cmd args\n R!ptrace   - use ptrace io\n R!mem      - use /proc/pid/mem io if possible\n R!pid      - show targeted pid\n R!pid &lt;#&gt;  - select new pid\nIn general, debugger commands are portable between architectures and operating systems. Still, as rizin tries to support the same functionality for all target architectures and operating systems, certain things have to be handled separately. They include injecting shellcodes and handling exceptions. For example, in MIPS targets there is no hardware-supported single-stepping feature. In this case, rizin provides its own implementation for single-step by using a mix of code analysis and software breakpoints.\nTo get basic help for the debugger, type ‘d?’:\nUsage: d   # Debug commands\n| db[?]                    Breakpoints commands\n| dbt[?]                   Display backtrace based on dbg.btdepth and dbg.btalgo\n| dc[?]                    Continue execution\n| dd[?]                    File descriptors (!fd in r1)\n| de[-sc] [perm] [rm] [e]  Debug with ESIL (see de?)\n| dg &lt;file&gt;                Generate a core-file (WIP)\n| dH [handler]             Transplant process to a new handler\n| di[?]                    Show debugger backend information (See dh)\n| dk[?]                    List, send, get, set, signal handlers of child\n| dL[?]                    List or set debugger handler\n| dm[?]                    Show memory maps\n| do[?]                    Open process (reload, alias for 'oo')\n| doo[args]                Reopen in debug mode with args (alias for 'ood')\n| doof[file]               Reopen in debug mode from file (alias for 'oodf')\n| doc                      Close debug session\n| dp[?]                    List, attach to process or thread id\n| dr[?]                    Cpu registers\n| ds[?]                    Step, over, source line\n| dt[?]                    Display instruction traces\n| dw &lt;pid&gt;                 Block prompt until pid dies\n| dx[?]                    Inject and run code on target process (See gs)\nTo restart your debugging session, you can type oo or oo+, depending on desired behavior.\noo                 reopen current file (kill+fork in debugger)\noo+                reopen current file in read-write",

    "text": "The ability to understand and manipulate the memory maps of a debugged program is important for many different Reverse Engineering tasks. rizin offers a rich set of commands to handle memory maps in the binary. This includes listing the memory maps of the currently debugged binary, removing memory maps, handling loaded libraries and more.\nFirst, let’s see the help message for dm, the command which is responsible for handling memory maps:\n[0x55f2104cf620]&gt; dm?\nUsage: dm   # Memory maps commands\n| dm                               List memory maps of target process\n| dm address size                  Allocate &lt;size&gt; bytes at &lt;address&gt; (anywhere if address is -1) in child process\n| dm=                              List memory maps of target process (ascii-art bars)\n| dm.

For the following examples, we’ll use a simple helloworld program for Linux but it’ll be the same for every binary.\nFirst things first - open a program in debugging mode:\n$ rizin -d helloworld\nProcess with PID 20304 started...\n= attach 20304 20304\nbin.baddr 0x56136b475000\nUsing 0x56136b475000\nasm.bits 64\n[0x7f133f022fb0]&gt;\n\nNote that we passed “helloworld” to rizin without “./”. rizin will try to find this program in the current directory and then in $PATH, even if no “./” is passed. This is contradictory with UNIX systems, but makes the behaviour consistent for windows users\n\nLet’s use dm to print the memory maps of the binary we’ve just opened:\n[0x7f133f022fb0]&gt; dm\n0x0000563a0113a000 - usr   4K s r-x /tmp/helloworld /tmp/helloworld ; map.tmp_helloworld.r_x\n0x0000563a0133a000 - usr   8K s rw- /tmp/helloworld /tmp/helloworld ; map.tmp_helloworld.rw\n0x00007f133f022000 * usr 148K s r-x /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so ; map.usr_lib_ld_2.27.so.r_x\n0x00007f133f246000 - usr   8K s rw- /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so ; map.usr_lib_ld_2.27.so.rw\n0x00007f133f248000 - usr   4K s rw- unk0 unk0 ; map.unk0.rw\n0x00007fffd25ce000 - usr 132K s rw- [stack] [stack] ; map.stack_.rw\n0x00007fffd25f6000 - usr  12K s r-- [vvar] [vvar] ; map.vvar_.r\n0x00007fffd25f9000 - usr   8K s r-x [vdso] [vdso] ; map.vdso_.r_x\n0xffffffffff600000 - usr   4K s r-x [vsyscall] [vsyscall] ; map.vsyscall_.r_x\nFor those of you who prefer a more visual way, you can use dm= to see the memory maps using an ASCII-art bars. This will be handy when you want to see how these maps are located in the memory.\nIf you want to know the memory-map you are currently in, use dm.:\n[0x7f133f022fb0]&gt; dm.\n0x00007f947eed9000 # 0x00007f947eefe000 * usr   148K s r-x /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so ; map.usr_lib_ld_2.27.so.r_x\nUsing dmm we can “List modules (libraries, binaries loaded in memory)”, this is quite a handy command to see which modules were loaded.\n[0x7fa80a19dfb0]&gt; dmm\n0x55ca23a4a000 /tmp/helloworld\n0x7fa80a19d000 /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so\n\nNote that the output of dm subcommands, and dmm specifically, might be different in various systems and different binaries.\n\nWe can see that along with our helloworld binary itself, another library was loaded which is ld-2.27.so. We don’t see libc yet and this is because rizin breaks before libc is loaded to memory. Let’s use dcu (debug continue until) to execute our program until the entry point of the program, which rizin flags as entry0.\n[0x7fa80a19dfb0]&gt; dcu entry0\nContinue until 0x55ca23a4a520 using 1 bpsize\nhit breakpoint at: 55ca23a4a518\n[0x55ca23a4a520]&gt; dmm\n0x55ca23a4a000 /tmp/helloworld\n0x7fa809de1000 /usr/lib/libc-2.27.so\n0x7fa80a19d000 /usr/lib/ld-2.27.so\nNow we can see that libc-2.27.so was loaded as well, great!\nSpeaking of libc, a popular task for binary exploitation is to find the address of a specific symbol in a library. With this information in hand, you can build, for example, an exploit which uses ROP. This can be achieved using the dmi command. So if we want, for example, to find the address of system() in the loaded libc, we can simply execute the following command:\n[0x55ca23a4a520]&gt; dmi libc system\n514 0x00000000 0x7fa809de1000  LOCAL  FILE    0 system.c\n515 0x00043750 0x7fa809e24750  LOCAL  FUNC 1221 do_system\n4468 0x001285a0 0x7fa809f095a0 LOCAL  FUNC  100 svcerr_systemerr\n5841 0x001285a0 0x7fa809f095a0 LOCAL  FUNC  100 svcerr_systemerr\n6427 0x00043d10 0x7fa809e24d10  WEAK  FUNC   45 system\n7094 0x00043d10 0x7fa809e24d10 GLBAL  FUNC   45 system\n7480 0x001285a0 0x7fa809f095a0 GLBAL  FUNC  100 svcerr_systemerr\nSimilar to the dm. command, with dmi. you can see the closest symbol to the current address.\nAnother useful command is to list the sections of a specific library. In the following example we’ll list the sections of ld-2.27.so:\n[0x55a7ebf09520]&gt; dmS ld-2.27\n[Sections]\n00 0x00000000     0 0x00000000     0 ---- ld-2.27.so.\n01 0x000001c8    36 0x4652d1c8    36 -r-- ld-2.27.so..note.gnu.build_id\n02 0x000001f0   352 0x4652d1f0   352 -r-- ld-2.27.so..hash\n03 0x00000350   412 0x4652d350   412 -r-- ld-2.27.so..gnu.hash\n04 0x000004f0   816 0x4652d4f0   816 -r-- ld-2.27.so..dynsym\n05 0x00000820   548 0x4652d820   548 -r-- ld-2.27.so..dynstr\n06 0x00000a44    68 0x4652da44    68 -r-- ld-2.27.so..gnu.version\n07 0x00000a88   164 0x4652da88   164 -r-- ld-2.27.so..gnu.version_d\n08 0x00000b30  1152 0x4652db30  1152 -r-- ld-2.27.so..rela.dyn\n09 0x00000fb0 11497 0x4652dfb0 11497 -r-x ld-2.27.so..text\n10 0x0001d0e0 17760 0x4654a0e0 17760 -r-- ld-2.27.so..rodata\n11 0x00021640  1716 0x4654e640  1716 -r-- ld-2.27.so..eh_frame_hdr\n12 0x00021cf8  9876 0x4654ecf8  9876 -r-- ld-2.27.so..eh_frame\n13 0x00024660  2020 0x46751660  2020 -rw- ld-2.27.so..data.rel.ro\n14 0x00024e48   336 0x46751e48   336 -rw- ld-2.27.so..dynamic\n15 0x00024f98    96 0x46751f98    96 -rw- ld-2.27.so..got\n16 0x00025000  3960 0x46752000  3960 -rw- ld-2.27.so..data\n17 0x00025f78     0 0x46752f80   376 -rw- ld-2.27.so..bss\n18 0x00025f78    17 0x00000000    17 ---- ld-2.27.so..comment\n19 0x00025fa0    63 0x00000000    63 ---- ld-2.27.so..gnu.warning.llseek\n20 0x00025fe0 13272 0x00000000 13272 ---- ld-2.27.so..symtab\n21 0x000293b8  7101 0x00000000  7101 ---- ld-2.27.so..strtab\n22 0x0002af75   215 0x00000000   215 ---- ld-2.27.so..shstrtab",

    "text": "Rizin has reverse debugger, that can seek the program counter backward. (e.g. reverse-next, reverse-continue in gdb) Firstly you need to save program state at the point that you want to start recording. The syntax for recording is:\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dts+\nYou can use dts commands for recording and managing program states. After recording the states, you can seek pc back and forth to any points after saved address. So after recording, you can try single step back:\n[0x004028a0]&gt; 2dso\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dr rip\n0x004028ae\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dsb\ncontinue until 0x004028a2\nhit breakpoint at: 4028a2\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dr rip\n0x004028a2\nWhen you run dsb, reverse debugger restore previous recorded state and execute program from it until desired point.\nOr you can also try continue back:\n[0x004028a0]&gt; db @ 0x004028a2\n[0x004028a0]&gt; 10dso\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dr rip\n0x004028b9\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dcb\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dr rip\n0x004028a2\ndcb seeks program counter until hit the latest breakpoint. So once set a breakpoint, you can back to it any time.\nYou can see current recorded program states using dts:\n[0x004028a0]&gt; dts\nsession: 0   at:0x004028a0   \"\"\nsession: 1   at:0x004028c2   \"\"\nNOTE: Program records can be saved at any moments. These are diff style format that save only different memory area from previous. It saves memory space rather than entire dump.\nAnd also can add comment:\n[0x004028c2]&gt; dtsC 0 program start\n[0x004028c2]&gt; dtsC 1 decryption start\n[0x004028c2]&gt; dts\nsession: 0   at:0x004028a0   \"program start\"\nsession: 1   at:0x004028c2   \"decryption start\"\nYou can leave notes for each records to keep in your mind. dsb and dcb commands restore the program state from latest record if there are many records.\nProgram records can exported to file and of course import it. Export/Import records to/from file:\n[0x004028c2]&gt; dtst records_for_test\nSession saved in records_for_test.session and dump in records_for_test.dump\n[0x004028c2]&gt; dtsf records_for_test\nsession: 0, 0x4028a0 diffs: 0\nsession: 1, 0x4028c2 diffs: 0\nMoreover, you can do reverse debugging in ESIL mode. In ESIL mode, program state can be managed by aets commands.\n[0x00404870]&gt; aets+\nAnd step back by aesb:\n[0x00404870]&gt; aer rip\n0x00404870\n[0x00404870]&gt; 5aeso\n[0x00404870]&gt; aer rip\n0x0040487d\n[0x00404870]&gt; aesb\n[0x00404870]&gt; aer rip\n0x00404879\nIn addition to the native reverse debugging capabilities in rizin, it’s also possible to use gdb’s remote protocol to reverse debug a target gdbserver that supports it.

First, Add the server with ‘R+ tcp://’ or ‘R+ udp://’, then you can redirect the output of a command to be sent to the server:\n[0x004048c5]&gt; R+ tcp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/\nConnected to: &lt;host&gt; at port &lt;port&gt;\n5 - tcp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/\n[0x004048c5]&gt; R&lt;5 cmd...\nThe R&lt; command will send the output from the execution of cmd to the remote connection number N (or the last one used if no id specified).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "rizin allows remote debugging over the gdb remote protocol. So you can run a gdbserver and connect to it with rizin for remote debugging. The syntax for connecting is:\n$ rizin -d gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;\nNote that the following command does the same, rizin will use the debug plugin specified by the uri if found.\n$ rizin -D gdb gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;\nThe debug plugin can be changed at runtime using the dL or Ld commands.\nOr if the gdbserver is running in extended mode, you can attach to a process on the host with:\n$ rizin -d gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;pid&gt;\nIt is also possible to start debugging after analyzing a file using the doof command which rebases the current session’s data after opening gdb\n[0x00404870]&gt; doof gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;pid&gt;\nAfter connecting, you can use the standard rizin debug commands as normal.\nrizin does not yet load symbols from gdbserver, so it needs the binary to be locally present to load symbols from it. In case symbols are not loaded even if the binary is present, you can try specifying the path with e dbg.exe.path:\n$ rizin -e dbg.exe.path=&lt;path&gt; -d gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;\nIf symbols are loaded at an incorrect base address, you can try specifying the base address too with e bin.baddr:\n$ rizin -e bin.baddr=&lt;baddr&gt; -e dbg.exe.path=&lt;path&gt; -d gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;\nUsually the gdbserver reports the maximum packet size it supports. Otherwise, rizin resorts to sensible defaults. But you can specify the maximum packet size with the environment variable R2_GDB_PKTSZ. You can also check and set the max packet size during a session with the IO system, R!.\n$ export R2_GDB_PKTSZ=512\n$ rizin -d gdb://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;\n= attach &lt;pid&gt; &lt;tid&gt;\nAssuming filepath &lt;path/to/exe&gt;\n[0x7ff659d9fcc0]&gt; R!pktsz\npacket size: 512 bytes\n[0x7ff659d9fcc0]&gt; R!pktsz 64\n[0x7ff659d9fcc0]&gt; R!pktsz\npacket size: 64 bytes\nThe gdb IO system provides useful commands which might not fit into any standard rizin commands. You can get a list of these commands with R!?. (Remember, R! accesses the underlying IO plugin’s system()).\n[0x7ff659d9fcc0]&gt; R!?\nUsage: R!cmd args\n R!pid             - show targeted pid\n R!pkt s           - send packet 's'\n R!monitor cmd     - hex-encode monitor command and pass to target interpreter\n R!rd              - show reverse debugging availability\n R!dsb             - step backwards\n R!dcb             - continue backwards\n R!detach [pid]    - detach from remote/detach specific pid\n R!inv.reg         - invalidate reg cache\n R!pktsz           - get max packet size used\n R!pktsz bytes     - set max. packet size as 'bytes' bytes\n R!exec_file [pid] - get file which was executed for current/specified pid\nNote that R!dsb and R!dcb are only available in special gdbserver implementations such as Mozilla’s rr, the default gdbserver doesn’t include remote reverse debugging support. Use R!rd to print the currently available reverse debugging capabilities.\nIf you are interested in debugging rizin’s interaction with gdbserver you can use R!monitor set remote-debug 1 to turn on logging of gdb’s remote protocol packets in gdbserver’s console and R!monitor set debug 1 to show general debug messages from gdbserver in it’s console.\nrizin also provides its own gdbserver implementation:\n$ rizin =\n[0x00000000]&gt; Rg?\n|Usage:  =[g] [...] # gdb server\n| gdbserver:\n| Rg port file [args]   listen on 'port' debugging 'file' using gdbserver\n| Rg! port file [args]  same as above, but debug protocol messages (like gdbserver --remote-debug)\nSo you can start it as:\n$ rizin =\n[0x00000000]&gt; Rg 8000 /bin/rizin -\nAnd then connect to it like you would to any gdbserver. For example, with rizin:\n$ rizin -d gdb://localhost:8000",

    "text": "Assembling is the action to take a computer instruction in human readable form (using mnemonics) and convert that into a bunch of bytes that can be executed by a machine.\nIn rizin, the assembler and disassembler logic is implemented in the rz_asm_* API, and can be used with the pa and pad commands from the commandline as well as using rz-asm.\nRz-asm can be used to quickly copy-paste hexpairs that represent a given machine instruction. The following line is assembling this mov instruction for x86/32.\n$ rz-asm -a x86 -b 32 'mov eax, 33'\nb821000000\nApart from the specifying the input as an argument, you can also pipe it to rz-asm:\n$ echo 'push eax;nop;nop' | rz-asm -f -\n5090\nAs you have seen, rz-asm can assemble one or many instructions. In line by separating them with a semicolon ;, but can also read that from a file, using generic nasm/gas/.. syntax and directives. You can check the rz-asm manpage for more details on this.\nThe pa and pad are a subcommands of print, what means they will only print assembly or disassembly. In case you want to actually write the instruction it is required to use wa or wx commands with the assembly string or bytes appended.\nThe assembler understands the following input languages and their flavors: x86 (Intel and AT&T variants), olly (OllyDBG syntax), powerpc (PowerPC), arm and java. For Intel syntax, rz-asm tries to mimic NASM or GAS.\nThere are several examples in the rz-asm source code directory. Consult them to understand how you can assemble a raw binary file from a rz-asm description.\nLets create an assembly file called selfstop.rzasm:\n;\n; Self-Stop shellcode written in rz-asm for x86\n;\n; --pancake\n;\n\n.arch x86\n.equ base 0x8048000\n.org 0x8048000  ; the offset where we inject the 5 byte jmp\n\nselfstop:\n  push 0x8048000\n  pusha\n  mov eax, 20\n  int 0x80\n\n  mov ebx, eax\n  mov ecx, 19\n  mov eax, 37\n  int 0x80\n  popa\n  ret\n;\n; The call injection\n;\n\n  ret\nNow we can assemble it in place:\n[0x00000000]&gt; e asm.bits=32\n[0x00000000]&gt; wx `!rz-asm -f a.rzasm`\n[0x00000000]&gt; pd 20\n       0x00000000    6800800408   push 0x8048000 ;  0x08048000\n       0x00000005    60           pushad\n       0x00000006    b814000000   mov eax, 0x14 ;  0x00000014\n       0x0000000b    cd80         int 0x80\n          syscall[0x80][0]=?\n       0x0000000d    89c3         mov ebx, eax\n       0x0000000f    b913000000   mov ecx, 0x13 ;  0x00000013\n       0x00000014    b825000000   mov eax, 0x25 ;  0x00000025\n       0x00000019    cd80         int 0x80\n          syscall[0x80][0]=?\n       0x0000001b    61           popad\n       0x0000001c    c3           ret\n       0x0000001d    c3           ret\n\n90.0.1 Visual mode\nAssembling also is accessible in rizin visual mode through pressing A key to insert the assembly in the current offset.\nThe cool thing of writing assembly using the visual assembler interface that the changes are done in memory until you press enter.\nSo you can check the size of the code and which instructions is overlapping before committing the changes.",

    "text": "All access to files, network, debugger and all input/output in general is wrapped by an IO abstraction layer that allows rizin to treat all data as if it were just a file.\nIO plugins are the ones used to wrap the open, read, write and ‘system’ on virtual file systems. You can make rizin understand anything as a plain file. E.g. a socket connection, a remote rizin session, a file, a process, a device, a gdb session.\nSo, when rizin reads a block of bytes, it is the task of an IO plugin to get these bytes from any place and put them into internal buffer. An IO plugin is chosen by a file’s URI to be opened. Some examples:\n\nDebugging URIs\n\n$ rizin dbg:///bin/ls&lt;br /&gt;\n$ rizin pid://1927\n\nRemote sessions\n\n$ rizin rap://:1234&lt;br /&gt;\n$ rizin rap://&lt;host&gt;:1234//bin/ls\n\nVirtual buffers\n\n$ rizin malloc://512&lt;br /&gt;\nshortcut for\n$ rizin =\nYou can get a list of the rizin IO plugins by typing rizin -L:\n$ rizin -L\nrw_  ar       Open ar/lib files [ar|lib]://[file//path] (LGPL3)\nrw_  bfdbg    BrainFuck Debugger (bfdbg://path/to/file) (LGPL3)\nrwd  bochs    Attach to a BOCHS debugger (LGPL3)\nr_d  debug    Native debugger (dbg:///bin/ls dbg://1388 pidof:// waitfor://) (LGPL3) v0.2.0 pancake\nrw_  default  open local files using def_mmap:// (LGPL3)\nrwd  gdb      Attach to gdbserver, 'qemu -s', gdb://localhost:1234 (LGPL3)\nrw_  gprobe   open gprobe connection using gprobe:// (LGPL3)\nrw_  gzip     read/write gzipped files (LGPL3)\nrw_  http     http get (http://rada.re/) (LGPL3)\nrw_  ihex     Intel HEX file (ihex://eeproms.hex) (LGPL)\nr__  mach     mach debug io (unsupported in this platform) (LGPL)\nrw_  malloc   memory allocation (malloc://1024 hex://cd8090) (LGPL3)\nrw_  mmap     open file using mmap:// (LGPL3)\nrw_  null     null-plugin (null://23) (LGPL3)\nrw_  procpid  /proc/pid/mem io (LGPL3)\nrwd  ptrace   ptrace and /proc/pid/mem (if available) io (LGPL3)\nrwd  qnx      Attach to QNX pdebug instance, qnx://host:1234 (LGPL3)\nrw_  rzk      kernel access API io (rzk://) (LGPL3)\nrw_  rz-pipe   rz-pipe io plugin (MIT)\nrw_  rzweb    rzweb io client (rzweb://cloud.rada.re/cmd/) (LGPL3)\nrw_  rap      rizin network protocol (rap://:port rap://host:port/file) (LGPL3)\nrw_  rbuf     RBuffer IO plugin: rbuf:// (LGPL)\nrw_  self     read memory from myself using 'self://' (LGPL3)\nrw_  shm      shared memory resources (shm://key) (LGPL3)\nrw_  sparse   sparse buffer allocation (sparse://1024 sparse://) (LGPL3)\nrw_  tcp      load files via TCP (listen or connect) (LGPL3)\nrwd  windbg   Attach to a KD debugger (windbg://socket) (LGPL3)\nrwd  winedbg  Wine-dbg io and debug.io plugin for rizin (MIT)\nrw_  zip      Open zip files [apk|ipa|zip|zipall]://[file//path] (BSD)",

    "text": "After implementing disassembly plugin, you might have noticed that output is far from being good - no proper highlighting, no reference lines and so on. This is because rizin requires every architecture plugin to provide also analysis information about every opcode. At the moment the implementation of disassembly and opcodes analysis is separated between two modules - RzAsm and RzAnalysis. Thus we need to write an analysis plugin too. The principle is very similar - you just need to create a C file and corresponding Makefile.\nThey structure of RzAnalysis plugin looks like\nRzAnalysisPlugin rz_analysis_plugin_v810 = {\n    .name = \"mycpu\",\n    .desc = \"MYCPU code analysis plugin\",\n    .license = \"LGPL3\",\n    .arch = \"mycpu\",\n    .bits = 32,\n    .op = mycpu_op,\n    .esil = true,\n    .set_reg_profile = set_reg_profile,\n};\nLike with disassembly plugin there is a key function - mycpu_op which scans the opcode and builds RzAnalysisOp structure. On the other hand, in this example analysis plugins also performs uplifting to ESIL, which is enabled in .esil = true statement. Thus, mycpu_op obliged to fill the corresponding RzAnalysisOp ESIL field for the opcodes. Second important thing for ESIL uplifting and emulation - register profile, like in debugger, which is set within set_reg_profile function.\nMakefile\nNAME=analysis_mycpu\nRZ_PLUGIN_PATH=$(shell rizin -H RZ_USER_PLUGINS)\nLIBEXT=$(shell rizin -H LIBEXT)\nCFLAGS=-g -fPIC $(shell pkg-config --cflags rz_analysis)\nLDFLAGS=-shared $(shell pkg-config --libs rz_analysis)\nOBJS=$(NAME).o\nLIB=$(NAME).$(LIBEXT)\n\nall: $(LIB)\n\nclean:\n    rm -f $(LIB) $(OBJS)\n\n$(LIB): $(OBJS)\n    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $(LIB)\n\ninstall:\n    cp -f analysis_mycpu.$(SO_EXT) $(RZ_PLUGIN_PATH)\n\nuninstall:\n    rm -f $(RZ_PLUGIN_PATH)/analysis_mycpu.$(SO_EXT)\nanalysis_mycpu.c: This is a dummy example please go check real life examples in the source.\n/* rizin - LGPL - Copyright 2022 - user */\n\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;rz_types.h&gt;\n#include &lt;rz_lib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;rz_asm.h&gt;\n#include &lt;rz_analysis.h&gt;\n\n#define NB_INST 2\n\ntypedef struct {\n    const char *name;\n    ut8 len;\n} mycpu_op_t;\n\nstatic mycpu_op_t mycpu_op[] = {\n    /*00*/  { \"nop\",    2 }, //enough\n    /*01*/  { \"ret\",    2 },\n}\n\nstatic int mycpu_anop(RzAnalysis *analysis, RzAnalysisOp *op, ut64 addr, const ut8 *data, int len) {\n    if (data[0] &lt; NB_INST) {\n        op-&gt;size = mycpu_op[data[0]].len;\n        op-&gt;addr = addr;\n        op-&gt;type = RZ_ANALYSIS_OP_TYPE_UNK;\n        switch (data[0]) {\n            case 0x00:\n                op-&gt;type = RZ_ANALYSIS_OP_TYPE_NOP;\n                break;\n            case 0x01:\n                op-&gt;type = RZ_ANALYSIS_OP_TYPE_RET;\n                break;\n        }\n        return op-&gt;size;\n    }\n}\n\nstruct rz_analysis_plugin_t rz_analysis_plugin_mycpu = {\n    .name = \"mycpu\",\n    .desc = \"MYCPU analysis plugin\",\n    .license = \"LGPL3\",\n    .arch = RZ_SYS_ARCH_NONE,\n    .bits = 16,\n    .init = NULL,\n    .fini = NULL,\n    .op = &mycpu_anop,\n    .set_reg_profile = NULL,\n    .fingerprint_bb = NULL,\n    .fingerprint_fcn = NULL,\n    .diff_bb = NULL,\n    .diff_fcn = NULL,\n    .diff_eval = NULL\n};\n\n#ifndef RZ_PLUGIN_INCORE\nRZ_API RzLibStruct rizin_plugin = {\n    .type = RZ_LIB_TYPE_ANALYSIS,\n    .data = &rz_analysis_plugin_mycpu,\n    .version = RZ_VERSION\n};\n#endif\nAfter compiling rizin will list this plugin in the rz-asm output:\n_dA_  _8_16      mycpu        LGPL3   MYCPU disassembly plugin\nNote the A just appeared on the left column (a=asm, d=disasm, A=analyze, e=ESIL).\nExamples:\n\nRzAnalysis plugin for 6502\nRzAnalysis plugin for SNES",

In this case, the password function at 0x0804842b was comparing the input against the value, 0x149a in hex. Since user input is usually decimal, it was a safe bet that the input was intended to be in decimal, or 5274. Now, since we’re hackers, and curiosity drives us, let’s see what happens when we input in hex.\n$ ./crackme0x01\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x01\nPassword: 0x149a\nInvalid Password!\nIt was worth a shot, but it doesn’t work. That’s because scanf() will take the 0 in 0x149a to be a zero, rather than accepting the input as actually being the hex value.\nAnd this concludes IOLI 0x01.",

We can’t check the value of this variable directly. It’s a common case in reverse engineering that we have to derive the value of the variable from the previous sequence. As the amount of code is relatively small, it can be easily done.\nfor example:\n|           0x080483ed      b800000000     mov eax, 0\n|           0x080483f2      83c00f         add eax, 0xf                ; 15\n|           0x080483f5      83c00f         add eax, 0xf                ; 15\n|           0x080483f8      c1e804         shr eax, 4\n|           0x080483fb      c1e004         shl eax, 4\n|           0x080483fe      29c4           sub esp, eax\nWe can easily get the value of eax. It’s 16.\nDirectly looking at the disassembly gets hard when the scale of program grows. Rizin’s flagship decompiler rz-ghidra might be of help, here. You can install it easily:\nrz-pm -i rz-ghidra\nDecompile main() with the following command (like F5 in IDA):\n[0x08048330]&gt; pdg\nundefined4 main(void)\n{\n    uint32_t var_ch;\n    undefined4 var_8h;\n    int32_t var_4h;\n    \n    printf(\"IOLI Crackme Level 0x02\\n\");\n    printf(\"Password: \");\n    scanf(0x804856c, &var_4h);\n    if (var_4h == 0x52b24) {\n        printf(\"Password OK :)\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Invalid Password!\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\nIt’s more human-readable now. To check the string in 0x804856c, we can: * Seek * Print the string\n[0x08048330]&gt; s 0x804856c\n[0x0804856c]&gt; ps\n%d\nIt’s exactly the format string of scanf(). And rz-ghidra recognizes that the second argument (eax) is a pointer and it points to var_4h. Which means our input will be stored in var_4h.\nWe can easily write out the pseudo code here.\nvar_ch = (var_8h + var_ch)^2;\nif (var_ch == our_input)\n  printf(\"Password OK :)\\n\");\nGiven the initial status that var_8h is 0x5a, var_ch is 0x1ec, we have var_ch = 338724 (0x52b24):\n$ rz-ax '=10' '(0x5a+0x1ec)*(0x5a+0x1ec)'\n338724\n\n$ ./crackme0x02\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x02\nPassword: 338724\nPassword OK :)\nAnd we finish the crackme0x02.",

We can guess that shift() is most likely some sort of decoding step of the seemingly random strings (shift cipher, e.g. Caesar cipher).\nTo confirm our suspicions let’s analyze sym.shift().\n[0x08048360]&gt; pdg @ sym.shift\n\n// WARNING: Variable defined which should be unmapped: var_98h\n\nvoid sym.shift(char *s)\n{\n    uint32_t uVar1;\n    int32_t var_98h;\n    unsigned long var_80h;\n    int32_t var_7ch;\n    \n    var_80h = 0;\n    while( true ) {\n        uVar1 = sym.imp.strlen(s);\n        if (uVar1 &lt;= var_80h) break;\n        *(char *)((int32_t)&var_7ch + var_80h) = s[var_80h] + -3;\n        var_80h = var_80h + 1;\n    }\n    *(undefined *)((int32_t)&var_7ch + var_80h) = 0;\n    sym.imp.printf(data.080485e8, &var_7ch);\n    return;\n}\nIf we clean this up a bit it becomes more evident what is going on.\nvoid shift(char *str)\n{\n    uint32_t len = strlen(str);\n    char res[len + 1];\n    \n    int32_t idx = 0;\n    while( idx &lt; len ) {\n        res[idx] = str[idx] - 3; // Subtract character code by 3\n        idx++;\n    }\n    res[idx] = 0; // Add null terminator\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", res);\n    return;\n}\nWe can see that each character in str is subtracted by 3 to produce the final result.\nWith this knowledge we can take a shot at decoding the strings.

Rizin provides us two ways of doing this: by using the debugger, or by emulation (using ESIL).\nLet’s first see how we can achieve this using the debugger. We will be wanting to pass the encoded strings to shift(). We know shift takes one parameter s, which is an address to a (null terminated) string. We can see where on the stack local variables and arguments are using the afvl command.\n$ rizin -d ./crackme0x03\n[0xec0ff970]&gt; aa\n[0xec0ff970]&gt; afvl @ sym.shift\nvar int32_t var_98h @ stack - 0x98\nvar unsigned long var_80h @ stack - 0x80\nvar int32_t var_7ch @ stack - 0x7c\narg const char *s @ stack + 0x4\nWe can see that s starts at a 4 byte offset from the stack pointer.\n[0xec0ff970]&gt; dcu main                      # run until program start\n[0x08048498]&gt; *esp+4=str.Lqydolg_Sdvvzrug   # 'push' address onto the stack (note the 4 byte offset)\n[0x08048498]&gt; dr eip=sym.shift              # set instruction pointer to start of shift()\n[0x08048498]&gt; dcr                           # run shift() until it returns\nInvalid Password!\n[0x0804846d]&gt; *esp+4=str.Sdvvzrug_RN        # and now for the other string\n[0x08048498]&gt; dr eip=sym.shift\n[0x08048498]&gt; dcr\nPassword OK!!! :)\nEmulation is a bit more tricky because we can’t make external calls to functions like strlen() and printf(). So we have to manually skip over them and set the registers accordingly. Below is an example.\n[0x08048414]&gt; s 0x08048445      # the 'sub al, 0x03'\n[0x08048445]&gt; aei               # init VM\n[0x08048445]&gt; aeim              # init memory\n[0x08048445]&gt; aeip              # init ip\n[0x08048445]&gt; ar eax=0x41       # set eax=0x41 -- 'A'\n[0x08048445]&gt; ar                # show current value of regs\noeax = 0x00000000\neax = 0x00000041\nebx = 0x00000000\necx = 0x00000000\nedx = 0x00000000\nesi = 0x00000000\nedi = 0x00000000\nesp = 0x00178000\nebp = 0x00178000\neip = 0x08048445\neflags = 0x00000000\n[0x08048445]&gt; V                 # enter Visual mode\n# 'p' or 'P' to change visual mode\n# I prefer the [xaDvc] mode\n# use 's' to step in and 'S' to step over\n[0x08048442 [xaDvc]0 0% 265 ./crackme0x03]&gt; diq;?0;f t.. @ sym.shift+46 # 0x8048442\ndead at 0x00000000\n- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF\n0x00178000  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................\n0x00178010  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................\n0x00178020  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................\n0x00178030  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................\n   oeax 0x00000000      eax 0x00000041      ebx 0x00000000      ecx 0x00000000\n    edx 0x00000000      esi 0x00000000      edi 0x00000000      esp 0x00178000\n    ebp 0x00178000      eip 0x08048445   eflags 0x00000000\n       :   0x08048442      0fb600         movzx eax, byte [eax]\n       :   ;-- eip:\n       :   0x08048445      2c03           sub al, 3\n       :   0x08048447      8802           mov byte [edx], al\n       :   0x08048449      8d4584         lea eax, [var_7ch]\n       :   0x0804844c      ff00           inc dword [eax]\n       :=&lt; 0x0804844e      ebd4           jmp 0x8048424\n           ; CODE XREF from sym.shift @ 0x8048432\n           0x08048450      8d4588         lea eax, [var_78h]",

As soon as var_ch equals 15 (0xf) we gain entry.\nOther than that however it may not be very obvious at first glance what exactly is going on here. So let’s start a debugging session to execute the function.\n$ rizin -d ./crackme0x04\n[0xf3666cd0]&gt; aaa\n[0xf3666cd0]&gt; dcu main          # execute until start of `main`\n[0x08048509]&gt; dr eip=sym.check  # instruction pointer to start of `check`\nWe will want to pass our own strings to check, so let’s allocate some memory and write a string to it.\n[0x08048509]&gt; dm+ 512 @ -1              # Allocate 512 bytes at anywhere (-1)\nra0=0xf3643000\n[0x08048509]&gt; wz \"letmein\" @ 0xf3643000 # Write null-terminated string to our allocated memory\n[0x08048509]&gt; *esp+4=0xf3643000         # store the address under `arg_4h` (stack + 0x04)\nThe password check completes if var_ch equals 15 (0xf) so let’s add a breakpoint that prints the value of var_ch. We are going to be putting the breakpoint at the comparison of var_ch and 0xf, try to find it using pdf @ sym.check.\n[0x08048508]&gt; pdf @ sym.check # find `cmp dword [var_ch], 0xf` \n...\n[0x08048508]&gt; db @ 0x080484d6                       # set breakpoint\n[0x08048508]&gt; dbc 'pxw 1 @ esp-0xc' @ 0x080484d6    # execute command on break\n[0x08048508]&gt; dcr                                   # execute until return\n0xffa833f0  0x00000004                                   . # l\n0xffa833f0  0x00000008                                   . # e\n0xffa833f0  0x0000000c                                   . # t\n0xffa833f0  0x00000010                                   . # m\n0xffa833f0  0x00000014                                   . # e\n0xffa833f0  0x00000018                                   . # i\n0xffa833f0  0x0000001c                                   . # n\nPassword Incorrect!\nWe can see that each letter increments var_ch by 4. Remember that sscanf in check takes a number (%d) as input. And because we didn’t provide any numbers, odds are that ‘4’ was probably some leftover data that happend to sit at the location of var_ch. This was never overwritten because sscanf didn’t encounter any numbers.\nSo let’s try giving it a number as input.\n[0x08048508]&gt; wz \"1234\" @ 0xf3643010\n[0x08048508]&gt; *esp+4=0xf3643010\n[0x08048508]&gt; dr eip=sym.check\n[0x08048508]&gt; dcr\n0xffa833f0  0x00000001                                   . # 1\n0xffa833f0  0x00000003                                   . # 2\n0xffa833f0  0x00000006                                   . # 3\n0xffa833f0  0x0000000a                                   . # 4\nPassword Incorrect!\nNow we see what the function check is actually supposed to do: it increments the counter by each digit encountered. Or in other words it computes the digit sum, which has to land on 15 at some point during the computation.\nAnd indeed, cleaning up the decompiled check makes this more obvious.\nvoid sym.check(char *s)\n{\n    int32_t var_11h = 0;\n    int32_t sum = 0;\n    int32_t d;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; strlen(s); i++) {\n        var_11h = s[i];\n        sscanf(&var_11h, \"%d\", &d);\n        sum += d;\n        if(sum == 0xf) {\n            printf(\"Password OK!\\n\");\n            exit(0);\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"Password Incorrect!\\n\");\n    return;\n}\n$ ./crackme0x04\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x04\nPassword: 12345\nPassword OK!\n\n$ ./crackme0x04\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x04\nPassword: 96\nPassword OK!\nUsing what we discovered when we entered non-digit characters we can get some other passwords to work as well.\n$ ./crackme0x04\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x04\nPassword: 5asdf\nPassword OK!\n\n$ ./crackme0x04\nIOLI Crackme Level 0x04\nPassword: 0this-will-not-increment1but-this-will:)\nPassword OK!",

    "text": "116.1 Wtf?\nAlready onto the eighth crackme!\nDoing our routine strings check we see another new contender, wtf? Literally.\nUpping the difficulty, check is no longer exported so it’s now listed as fcn.080485b9. To make our lives a bit easier, let’s set the name manually.\nThis looks like the check we’ve seen in previous version except there is now a parity check slapped on the end of it where the string “wtf?” is printed.\nBefore we can continue to the other functions, they have to be analyzed first. We can analyze all functions recursively using afr.\nThe reason we’re doing it this way in this case, is because aaa will cause some critical information to be omitted: namely the code that prints \"wtf?\", more on that later.\nFor now though let’s first check out fcn.08048542. We can probably already guess its identity as the code structure remains largely unchanged from the previous versions. But it can’t hurt to do our due diligence.\nThat does indeed look like parell from the previous versions. And that must make fcn.080484b4 dummy. But look, there’s an extra if inside the parity check! Apparently some global variable has to be set to 1 in order for the password to be valid.\nAnd this must be dummy… With an addition. Can you spot it? This is where that global variable that we saw earlier gets set! On the line containing *(undefined4 *)0x804a02c = 1;, more specifically.\nBut before we continue let’s see if there are any other references to or from this global variable.\nIt doesn’t appear to be the case, so let’s go back to check.\nWe still have one unidentified function left: fcn.08048524.\nThis doesn’t seem to do much, other than to print that the password is incorrect and exit. So let’s call it print_and_exit.\nInterestingly, print_and_exit is called unconditionally before the second parity check, meaning it is never executed under normal circumstances. If we had used aaa to analyze this binary, Rizin would have noticed this and it would have simply omitted it from the disassembly and decompilation outputs.\nIf you happen to accidentally (or intentionally) run aaa, you can remove all function analysis using af-*, after which you can run aa, followed by afr where needed.\nWith that being said, it doesn’t seem like the password constraints have changed at all from the previous versions:\nBefore we close Rizin however let’s save this as a project first, so we don’t lose all our hard work naming the functions.\nAnd as we concluded, the passwords from the previous version still work.\nWe could go to the next one. Technically we’ve solved this crackme. But we have some unfinished business: the wtf? string. Let’s see if we can find a way to reach the code that’s supposed to write it to the console!\nIt’s easy enough using the debugger: we can simply set the instruction pointer to some location after the print_and_exit function (remember dr eip=&lt;address&gt;).\nWe can reopen the current file in debug mode using the ood command. We do need an environment variable set that starts with LOL, we can achieve this using the dor command. And let’s also set a breakpoint at the location print_and_exit is called so we can jump over it manually.\nNow we should be at the instruction that reads call print_and_exit (confirm with pd 1 @ eip). Now we need to find the address of the instruction that comes after this one and set the instruction pointer to equal this value.\nWith the print_and_exit function skipped we can continue execution.\nWe’ve successfully triggered the wtf? code using the debugger. But that’s no fun! Let’s see if there is a way we can reach that code (semi-)naturally.\nIn order for the print_and_exit function to be called we have to fail parell or the digit sum check. Failing parell is tricky because the same version has to succeed after print_and_exit in order for our desired string to be printed. So we’ll have to fail the digit sum check, which means making sure that our digit sum will not land on 16 during the computation.\nEasy enough! The only problem we have is that exit stops the process… But what if we were to make our own version of exit?\nThis turns exit into something that, well, doesn’t exit. __builtin_return_address is used to look two call frames up for a return address (the return address of print_and_exit) and jumps to it. Let’s save it to a file called exit.c. Compile it to a shared library using gcc -m32 -shared -o libexit.so exit.c and then we can preload it using LD_PRELOAD.\nThere it is!\nNow that exit is a simple trampoline, something interesting happens when we enter a valid password.\n“Password OK!” No. “Password Incorrect!” wtf? indeed.",

It consisted of 8 challenges, most of them being basic web hacking stuff, one sandbox escape, one simple buffer overflow exploitation, and there were two reverse engineering exercises too.

    "text": "I’ve decided to solve the reversing challenges using rizin, a free and open source reverse engineering framework. I have first learned about rizin back in 2011. during a huge project, where I had to reverse a massive, 11MB statically linked ELF. I simply needed something that I could easily patch Linux ELFs with. Granted, back then I’ve used rizin alongside IDA, and only for smaller tasks, but I loved the whole concept at first sight. Since then, rizin evolved a lot, and I was planning for some time now to solve some crackmes with the framework, and write writeups about them. Well, this CTF gave me the perfect opportunity :)\nBecause this writeup aims to show some of rizin’s features besides how the crackmes can be solved, I will explain every rizin command I use in blockquote paragraphs like this one:\n\nrizin tip: Always use ? or -h to get more information!\n\nIf you know rizin, and just interested in the crackme, feel free to skip those parts! Also keep in mind please, that because of this tutorial style I’m going to do a lot of stuff that you just don’t do during a CTF, because there is no time for proper bookkeeping (e.g. flag every memory area according to its purpose), and with such small executables you can succeed without doing these stuff.\nA few advice if you are interested in learning rizin (and frankly, if you are into RE, you should be interested in learning rizin :) ):\nThe framework has a lot of supplementary executables and a vast amount of functionality - and they are very well documented. I encourage you to read the available docs, and use the built-in help (by appending a ? to any command) extensively! E.g.:\n[0x00000000]&gt; ?\nUsage: [.][times][cmd][~grep][@[@iter]addr!size][|&gt;pipe] ; ...\nAppend '?' to any char command to get detailed help\nPrefix with number to repeat command N times (f.ex: 3x)\n|%var =valueAlias for 'env' command\n| *off[=[0x]value]     Pointer read/write data/values (see ?v, wx, wv)\n| (macro arg0 arg1)    Manage scripting macros\n| .[-|(m)|f|!sh|cmd]   Define macro or load rizin, cparse or rlang file\n| = [cmd]              Run this command via rap://\n| /                    Search for bytes, regexps, patterns, ..\n| ! [cmd]              Run given command as in system(3)\n| # [algo] [len]       Calculate hash checksum of current block\n| #!lang [..]          Hashbang to run an rlang script\n| a                    Perform analysis of code\n| b                    Get or change block size\n\n...\n\n[0x00000000]&gt; a?\n|Usage: a[abdefFghoprxstc] [...]\n| ab [hexpairs]     analyze bytes\n| aa                analyze all (fcns + bbs) (aa0 to avoid sub renaming)\n| ac [cycles]       analyze which op could be executed in [cycles]\n| ad                analyze data trampoline (wip)\n| ad [from] [to]    analyze data pointers to (from-to)\n| ae [expr]         analyze opcode eval expression (see ao)\n| af[rnbcsl?+-*]    analyze Functions\n| aF                same as above, but using analysis.depth=1\n\n...\nAlso, the project is under heavy development, there is no day without commits to the GitHub repo.

First, you have to know your enemy:\n[0x00 avatao]$ rz-bin -I reverse4\npic      false\ncanary   true\nnx       true\ncrypto   false\nva       true\nintrp    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\nbintype  elf\nclass    ELF64\nlang     c\narch     x86\nbits     64\nmachine  AMD x86-64 architecture\nos       linux\nsubsys   linux\nendian   little\nstripped true\nstatic   false\nlinenum  false\nlsyms    false\nrelocs   false\nrpath    NONE\nbinsz    8620\n\nrizin tip: rz-bin is one of the handy tools that comes with rizin. It can be used to extract information (imports, symbols, libraries, etc.) about binary executables. As always, check the help (rz-bin -h)!\n\nSo, its a dynamically linked, stripped, 64bit Linux executable - nothing fancy here. Let’s try to run it:\n[0x00 avatao]$ ./reverse4\n?\nSize of data: 2623\npamparam\nWrong!\n\n[0x00 avatao]$ \"\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\" | ./reverse4\nSize of data: 1\nOK, so it reads a number as a size from the standard input first, than reads further, probably “size” bytes/characters, processes this input, and outputs either “Wrong!”, nothing or something else, presumably our flag. But do not waste any more time monkeyfuzzing the executable, let’s fire up rizin, because in asm we trust!\n[0x00 avatao]$ rizin -A reverse4\n -- Heisenbug: A bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one attempts to probe or isolate it.\n[0x00400720]&gt;\n\nrizin tip: The -A switch runs aaa command at start to analyze all referenced code, so we will have functions, strings, XREFS, etc. right at the beginning. As usual, you can get help with ?.\n\nIt is a good practice to create a project, so we can save our progress, and we can come back at a later time:\n[0x00400720]&gt; Ps avatao_reverse4\navatao_reverse4\n[0x00400720]&gt;\n\nrizin tip: You can save a project using Ps [file], and load one using Po [file]. With the -p option, you can load a project when starting rizin.\n\nWe can list all the strings rizin found:\n[0x00400720]&gt; fs strings\n[0x00400720]&gt; f\n0x00400e98 7 str.Wrong_\n0x00400e9f 27 str.We_are_in_the_outer_space_\n0x00400f80 18 str.Size_of_data:__u_n\n0x00400f92 23 str.Such_VM__MuCH_reV3rse_\n0x00400fa9 16 str.Use_everything_\n0x00400fbb 9 str.flag.txt\n0x00400fc7 26 str.You_won__The_flag_is:__s_n\n0x00400fe1 21 str.Your_getting_closer_\n[0x00400720]&gt;\n\nrizin tip: rizin puts so called flags on important/interesting offsets, and organizes these flags into flagspaces (strings, functions, symbols, etc.) You can list all flagspaces using fs, and switch the current one using fs [flagspace] (the default is *, which means all the flagspaces). The command f prints all flags from the currently selected flagspace(s).\n\nOK, the strings looks interesting, especially the one at 0x00400f92. It seems to hint that this crackme is based on a virtual machine. Keep that in mind!\nThese strings could be a good starting point if we were talking about a real-life application with many-many features. But we are talking about a crackme, and they tend to be small and simple, and focused around the problem to be solved. So I usually just take a look at the entry point(s) and see if I can figure out something from there. Nevertheless, I’ll show you how to find where these strings are used:\n[0x00400720]&gt; axt @@=`f~[0]`\nd 0x400cb5 mov edi, str.Size_of_data:__u_n\nd 0x400d1d mov esi, str.Such_VM__MuCH_reV3rse_\nd 0x400d4d mov edi, str.Use_everything_\nd 0x400d85 mov edi, str.flag.txt\nd 0x400db4 mov edi, str.You_won__The_flag_is:__s_n\nd 0x400dd2 mov edi, str.Your_getting_closer_\n\nrizin tip: We can list cross-references to addresses using the axt [addr] command (similarly, we can use axf to list references from the address). The *@@* is an iterator, it just runs the command once for every arguments listed.\nThe argument list in this case comes from the command f[0]. It lists the strings from the executable with f, and uses the internal grep command  to select only the first column ([0]) that contains the strings’ addresses.",

    "text": "As I was saying, I usually take a look at the entry point, so let’s just do that:\n[0x00400720]&gt; s main\n[0x00400c63]&gt;\n\nrizin tip: You can go to any offset, flag, expression, etc. in the executable using the s command (seek). You can use references, like $$ (current offset), you can undo (s-) or redo (s+) seeks, search strings (s/ [string]) or hex values (s/x 4142), and a lot of other useful stuff. Make sure to check out s?!\n\nNow that we are at the beginning of the main function, we could use p to show a disassembly (pd, pdf), but rizin can do something much cooler: it has a visual mode, and it can display graphs similar to IDA, but way cooler, since they are ASCII-art graphs :)\n\nrizin tip: The command family p is used to print stuff. For example it can show disassembly (pd), disassembly of the current function (pdf), print strings (ps), hexdump (px), base64 encode/decode data (p6e, p6d), or print raw bytes (pr) so you can for example dump parts of the binary to other files. There are many more functionalities, check ?!\n\nR2 also has a minimap view which is incredibly useful for getting an overall look at a function:\n\n\n\nmain functions’s minimap\n\n\n\nrizin tip: With command V you can enter the so-called visual mode, which has several views. You can switch between them using p and P. The graph view can be displayed by hitting V in visual mode (or using VV at the prompt).\nHitting p in graph view will bring up the minimap. It displays the basic blocks and the connections between them in the current function, and it also shows the disassembly of the currently selected block (marked with @@@@@ on the minimap). You can select the next or the previous block using the *&lt;TAB&gt;* and the *&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;* keys respectively. You can also select the true or the false branches using the t and the f keys.\nIt is possible to bring up the prompt in visual mode using the : key, and you can use o to seek.\n\nLets read main node-by-node! The first block looks like this:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0c63\n\n\nWe can see that the program reads a word (2 bytes) into the local variable named local_10_6, and than compares it to 0xbb8. That’s 3000 in decimal:\n[0x00400c63]&gt; % 0xbb8\nint32   3000\nuint32  3000\nhex     0xbb8\noctal   05670\nunit    2.9K\nsegment 0000:0bb8\nstring  \"\\xb8\\v\"\nfvalue  3000.0\nfloat   3000.000000f\ndouble  3000.000000\nbinary  0b0000101110111000\ntrits   0t11010010\n\nrizin tip: yep, % will evaluate expressions, and print the result in various formats.\n\nIf the value is greater than 3000, then it will be forced to be 3000:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0ca6\n\n\nThere are a few things happening in the next block:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0cac\n\n\nFirst, the “Size of data:” message we saw when we run the program is printed. So now we know that the local variable local_10_6 is the size of the input data - so lets name it accordingly (remember, you can open the rizin shell from visual mode using the : key!):\n:&gt; afvn local_10_6 input_size\n\nrizin tip: The af command family is used to analyze functions. This includes manipulating arguments and local variables too, which is accessible via the afv commands. You can list function arguments (afa), local variables (afv), or you can even rename them (afan, afvn). Of course there are lots of other features too - as usual: use the “?”, Luke!\n\nAfter this an input_size bytes long memory chunk is allocated, and filled with data from the standard input. The address of this memory chunk is stored in local_10 - time to use afvn again:\n:&gt; afvn local_10 input_data\nWe’ve almost finished with this block, there are only two things remained. First, an 512 (0x200) bytes memory chunk is zeroed out at offset 0x00602120. A quick glance at XREFS to this address reveals that this memory is indeed used somewhere in the application:\n:&gt; axt 0x00602120\nd 0x400cfe mov edi, 0x602120\nd 0x400d22 mov edi, 0x602120\nd 0x400dde mov edi, 0x602120\nd 0x400a51 mov qword [rbp - 8], 0x602120\nSince it probably will be important later on, we should label it:\n:&gt; f sym.memory 0x200 0x602120\n\nrizin tip: Flags can be managed using the f command family. We’ve just added the flag sym.memory to a 0x200 bytes long memory area at 0x602120. It is also possible to remove (f-name), rename (fr [old] [new]), add comment (fC [name] [cmt]) or even color (fc [name] [color]) flags.\n\nWhile we are here, we should also declare that memory chunk as data, so it will show up as a hexdump in disassembly view:\n:&gt; Cd 0x200 @ sym.memory\n\nrizin tip: The command family C is used to manage metadata. You can set (CC) or edit (CC) comments, declare memory areas as data (Cd), strings (Cs), etc. These commands can also be issued via a menu in visual mode invoked by pressing d.\n\nThe only remaining thing in this block is a function call to 0x400a45 with the input data as an argument. The function’s return value is compared to “*“, and a conditional jump is executed depending on the result.\nEarlier I told you that this crackme is probably based on a virtual machine. Well, with that information in mind, one can guess that this function will be the VM’s main loop, and the input data is the instructions the VM will execute. Based on this hunch, I’ve named this function vmloop, and renamed input_data to bytecode and input_size to bytecode_length. This is not really necessary in a small project like this, but it’s a good practice to name stuff according to their purpose (just like when you are writing programs).\n:&gt; af vmloop 0x400a45\n:&gt; afvn input_size bytecode_length\n:&gt; afvn input_data bytecode\n\nrizin tip: The af command is used to analyze a function with a given name at the given address. The other two commands should be familiar from earlier.\n\nAfter renaming local variables, flagging that memory area, and renaming the VM loop function the disassembly looks like this:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0cac_meta\n\n\nSo, back to that conditional jump. If vmloop returns anything else than “*“, the program just exits without giving us our flag. Obviously we don’t want that, so we follow the false branch.\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d1d\n\n\nNow we see that a string in that 512 bytes memory area (sym.memory) gets compared to “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!”. If they are not equal, the program prints the bytecode, and exits:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0dde\n\n\nOK, so now we know that we have to supply a bytecode that will generate that string when executed. As we can see on the minimap, there are still a few more branches ahead, which probably means more conditions to meet. Lets investigate them before we delve into vmloop!\nIf you take a look at the minimap of the whole function, you can probably recognize that there is some kind of loop starting at block [0d34], and it involves the following nodes:\n\n[0d34]\n[0d65]\n[0d3d]\n[0d61]\n\nHere are the assembly listings for those blocks. The first one puts 0 into local variable local_10_4:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d34\n\n\nAnd this one compares local_10_4 to 8, and executing a conditional jump based on the result:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d65\n\n\nIt’s pretty obvious that local_10_4 is the loop counter, so lets name it accordingly:\n:&gt; afvn local_10_4 i\nNext block is the actual loop body:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d3d\n\n\nThe memory area at 0x6020e0 is treated as an array of dwords (4 byte values), and checked if the ith value of it is zero. If it is not, the loop simply continues:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d61\n\n\nIf the value is zero, the loop breaks and this block is executed before exiting:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d4d\n\n\nIt prints the following message: Use everything!” As we’ve established earlier, we are dealing with a virtual machine. In that context, this message probably means that we have to use every available instructions. Whether we executed an instruction or not is stored at 0x6020e0 - so lets flag that memory area:\n:&gt; f sym.instr_dirty 4*9 0x6020e0\nAssuming we don’t break out and the loop completes, we are moving on to some more checks:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d6b\n\n\nThis piece of code may look a bit strange if you are not familiar with x86_64 specific stuff. In particular, we are talking about RIP-relative addressing, where offsets are described as displacements from the current instruction pointer, which makes implementing PIE easier. Anyways, rizin is nice enough to display the actual address (0x602104). Got the address, flag it!\n:&gt; f sym.good_if_ne_zero 4 0x602104\nKeep in mind though, that if RIP-relative addressing is used, flags won’t appear directly in the disassembly, but rizin displays them as comments:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d6b_meta\n\n\nIf sym.good_if_ne_zero is zero, we get a message (“Your getting closer!”), and then the program exits. If it is non-zero, we move to the last check:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d75\n\n\nHere the program compares a dword at 0x6020f0 (again, RIP-relative addressing) to 9. If its greater than 9, we get the same “Your getting closer!” message, but if it’s lesser, or equal to 9, we finally reach our destination, and get the flag:\n\n\n\nmain bb-0d80\n\n\nAs usual, we should flag 0x6020f0:\n:&gt; f sym.good_if_le_9 4 0x6020f0\nWell, it seems that we have fully reversed the main function. To summarize it: the program reads a bytecode from the standard input, and feeds it to a virtual machine. After VM execution, the program’s state have to satisfy these conditions in order to reach the goodboy code:\n\nvmloop’s return value has to be “*”\nsym.memory has to contain the string “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!”\nall 9 elements of sym.instr_dirty array should not be zero (probably means that all instructions had to be used at least once)\nsym.good_if_ne_zero should not be zero\nsym.good_if_le_9 has to be lesser or equal to 9\n\nThis concludes our analysis of the main function, we can now move on to the VM itself.",

    "text": "[offset]&gt; fcn.vmloop\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0a45\n\n\nWell, that seems disappointingly short, but no worries, we have plenty to reverse yet. The thing is that this function uses a jump table at 0x00400a74,\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0a74\n\n\nand rizin can’t yet recognize jump tables (Issue 3201), so the analysis of this function is a bit incomplete. This means that we can’t really use the graph view now, so either we just use visual mode, or fix those basic blocks. The entire function is just 542 bytes long, so we certainly could reverse it without the aid of the graph mode, but since this writeup aims to include as much rizin wisdom as possible, I’m going to show you how to define basic blocks.\nFirst, lets analyze what we already have! First, rdi is put into local_3. Since the application is a 64bit Linux executable, we know that rdi is the first function argument (as you may have recognized, the automatic analysis of arguments and local variables was not entirely correct), and we also know that vmloop’s first argument is the bytecode. So lets rename local_3:\n:&gt; afvn local_3 bytecode\nNext, sym.memory is put into another local variable at rbp-8 that rizin did not recognize. So let’s define it!\n:&gt; afv 8 memory qword\n\nrizin tip: The afv [idx] [name] [type] command is used to define local variable at [frame pointer - idx] with the name [name] and type [type]. You can also remove local variables using the afv- [idx] command.\n\nIn the next block, the program checks one byte of bytecode, and if it is 0, the function returns with 1.\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0c4d\n\n\nIf that byte is not zero, the program subtracts 0x41 from it, and compares the result to 0x17. If it is above 0x17, we get the dreaded “Wrong!” message, and the function returns with 0. This basically means that valid bytecodes are ASCII characters in the range of “A” (0x41) through “X” (0x41 + 0x17). If the bytecode is valid, we arrive at the code piece that uses the jump table:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0a74\n\n\nThe jump table’s base is at 0x400ec0, so lets define that memory area as a series of qwords:\n[0x00400a74]&gt; s 0x00400ec0\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; Cd 8 @@=`%s $$ $$+8*0x17 8`\n\nrizin tip: Except for the %s, all parts of this command should be familiar now, but lets recap it! Cd defines a memory area as data, and 8 is the size of that memory area. @@* is an iterator that make the preceding command run for every element that @@* holds. In this example it holds a series generated using the %s command. %s simply generates a series from the current seek (\\[*) to current seek + 8*0x17 (*\\]+80x17*) with a step of 8.\n\nThis is how the disassembly looks like after we add this metadata:\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; pd 0x18\n            ; DATA XREF from 0x00400a76 (unk)\n            0x00400ec0 .qword 0x0000000000400a80\n            0x00400ec8 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400ed0 .qword 0x0000000000400b6d\n            0x00400ed8 .qword 0x0000000000400b17\n            0x00400ee0 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400ee8 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400ef0 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400ef8 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f00 .qword 0x0000000000400aec\n            0x00400f08 .qword 0x0000000000400bc1\n            0x00400f10 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f18 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f20 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f28 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f30 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f38 .qword 0x0000000000400b42\n            0x00400f40 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f48 .qword 0x0000000000400be5\n            0x00400f50 .qword 0x0000000000400ab6\n            0x00400f58 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f60 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f68 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f70 .qword 0x0000000000400c04\n            0x00400f78 .qword 0x0000000000400b99\nAs we can see, the address 0x400c04 is used a lot, and besides that there are 9 different addresses. Lets see that 0x400c04 first!\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0c04\n\n\nWe get the message “Wrong!”, and the function just returns 0. This means that those are not valid instructions (they are valid bytecode though, they can be e.g. parameters!) We should flag 0x400c04 accordingly:\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f not_instr @ 0x0000000000400c04\nAs for the other offsets, they all seem to be doing something meaningful, so we can assume they belong to valid instructions. I’m going to flag them using the instructions’ ASCII values:\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_A @ 0x0000000000400a80\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_C @ 0x0000000000400b6d\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_D @ 0x0000000000400b17\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_I @ 0x0000000000400aec\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_J @ 0x0000000000400bc1\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_P @ 0x0000000000400b42\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_R @ 0x0000000000400be5\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_S @ 0x0000000000400ab6\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; f instr_X @ 0x0000000000400b99\nOk, so these offsets were not on the graph, so it is time to define basic blocks for them!\n\nrizin tip: You can define basic blocks using the afb+ command. You have to supply what function the block belongs to, where does it start, and what is its size. If the block ends in a jump, you have to specify where does it jump too. If the jump is a conditional jump, the false branch’s destination address should be specified too.\n\nWe can get the start and end addresses of these basic blocks from the full disasm of vmloop.\n\n\n\nvmloop full\n\n\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, the function itself is pretty short, and easy to read, especially with our annotations. But a promise is a promise, so here is how we can create the missing basic blocks for the instructions:\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400a80 0x00400ab6-0x00400a80 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400ab6 0x00400aec-0x00400ab6 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400aec 0x00400b17-0x00400aec 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b17 0x00400b42-0x00400b17 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b42 0x00400b6d-0x00400b42 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b6d 0x00400b99-0x00400b6d 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400b99 0x00400bc1-0x00400b99 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400bc1 0x00400be5-0x00400bc1 0x400c15\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400be5 0x00400c04-0x00400be5 0x400c15\nIt is also apparent from the disassembly that besides the instructions there are three more basic blocks. Lets create them too!\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c15 0x00400c2d-0x00400c15 0x400c3c 0x00400c2d\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c2d 0x00400c3c-0x00400c2d 0x400c4d 0x00400c3c\n[0x00400ec0]&gt; afb+ 0x00400a45 0x00400c3c 0x00400c4d-0x00400c3c 0x400c61\nNote that the basic blocks starting at 0x00400c15 and 0x00400c2d ending in a conditional jump, so we had to set the false branch’s destination too!\nAnd here is the graph in its full glory after a bit of manual restructuring:\n\n\n\nvmloop graph\n\n\nI think it worth it, don’t you? :) (Well, the restructuring did not really worth it, because it is apparently not stored when you save the project.)\n\nrizin tip: You can move the selected node around in graph view using the HJKL keys.\n\nBy the way, here is how IDA’s graph of this same function looks like for comparison:\n\n\n\nIDA graph\n\n\nAs we browse through the disassembly of the instr_LETTER basic blocks, we should realize a few things. The first: all of the instructions starts with a sequence like these:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0a80\n\n\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0ab6\n\n\nIt became clear now that the 9 dwords at sym.instr_dirty are not simply indicators that an instruction got executed, but they are used to count how many times an instruction got called. Also I should have realized earlier that sym.good_if_le_9 (0x6020f0) is part of this 9 dword array, but yeah, well, I didn’t, I have to live with it… Anyways, what the condition “sym.good_if_le_9 have to be lesser or equal 9” really means is that instr_P can not be executed more than 9 times:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0b42\n\n\nAnother similarity of the instructions is that 7 of them calls a function with either one or two parameters, where the parameters are the next, or the next two bytecodes. One parameter example:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0aec\n\n\nAnd a two parameters example:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0a80_full\n\n\nWe should also realize that these blocks put the number of bytes they eat up of the bytecode (1 byte instruction + 1 or 2 bytes arguments = 2 or 3) into a local variable at 0xc. rizin did not recognize this local var, so lets do it manually!\n:&gt; afv 0xc instr_ptr_step dword\nIf we look at instr_J we can see that this is an exception to the above rule, since it puts the return value of the called function into instr_ptr_step instead of a constant 2 or 3:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0bc1\n\n\nAnd speaking of exceptions, here are the two instructions that do not call functions:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0be5\n\n\nThis one simply puts the next bytecode (the first the argument) into eax, and jumps to the end of vmloop. So this is the VM’s ret instruction, and we know that vmloop has to return “*”, so “R*” should be the last two bytes of our bytecode.\nThe next one that does not call a function:\n\n\n\nvmloop bb-0b6d\n\n\nThis is a one argument instruction, and it puts its argument to 0x6020c0. Flag that address!\n:&gt; f sym.written_by_instr_C 4 @ 0x6020c0\nOh, and by the way, I do have a hunch that instr_C also had a function call in the original code, but it got inlined by the compiler. Anyways, so far we have these two instructions:\n\ninstr_R(a1): returns with a1\ninstr_C(a1): writes a1 to sym.written_by_instr_C\n\nAnd we also know that these accept one argument,\n\ninstr_I\ninstr_D\ninstr_P\ninstr_X\ninstr_J\n\nand these accept two:\n\ninstr_A\ninstr_S\n\nWhat remains is the reversing of the seven functions that are called by the instructions, and finally the construction of a valid bytecode that gives us the flag.\n###instr_A\nThe function this instruction calls is at offset 0x40080d, so lets seek there!\n[offset]&gt; 0x40080d\n\nrizin tip: In visual mode you can just hit &lt;Enter&gt; when the current line is a jump or a call, and rizin will seek to the destination address.\n\nIf we seek to that address from the graph mode, we are presented with a message that says “Not in a function. Type ‘df’ to define it here. This is because the function is called from a basic block rizin did not recognize, so rizin could not find the function either. Lets obey, and type df! A function is indeed created, but we want some meaningful name for it. So press dr while still in visual mode, and name this function instr_A!\n\n\n\ninstr_A minimap\n\n\n\nrizin tip: You should realize that these commands are all part of the same menu system in visual mode I was talking about when we first used Cd to declare sym.memory as data.\n\nOk, now we have our shiny new fcn.instr_A, lets reverse it! We can see from the shape of the minimap that probably there is some kind cascading if-then-elif, or a switch-case statement involved in this function. This is one of the reasons the minimap is so useful: you can recognize some patterns at a glance, which can help you in your analysis (remember the easily recognizable for loop from a few paragraphs before?) So, the minimap is cool and useful, but I’ve just realized that I did not yet show you the full graph mode, so I’m going to do this using full graph. The first basic blocks:\n\n\n\ninstr_A bb-080d\n\n\nThe two function arguments (rdi and rsi) are stored in local variables, and the first is compared to 0. If it is, the function returns (you can see it on the minimap), otherwise the same check is executed on the second argument. The function returns from here too, if the argument is zero. Although this function is really tiny, I am going to stick with my methodology, and rename the local vars:\n:&gt; afvn local_1 arg1\n:&gt; afvn local_2 arg2\nAnd we have arrived to the predicted switch-case statement, and we can see that arg1’s value is checked against “M”, “P”, and “C”.\n\n\n\ninstr_A switch values\n\n\nThis is the “M” branch:\n\n\n\ninstr_A switch-M\n\n\nIt basically loads an address from offset 0x602088 and adds arg2 to the byte at that address. As rizin kindly shows us in a comment, 0x602088 initially holds the address of sym.memory, the area where we have to construct the “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!” string. It is safe to assume that somehow we will be able to modify the value stored at 0x602088, so this “M” branch will be able to modify bytes other than the first. Based on this assumption, I’ll flag 0x602088 as sym.current_memory_ptr:\n:&gt; f sym.current_memory_ptr 8 @ 0x602088\nMoving on to the “P” branch:\n\n\n\ninstr_A switch-P\n\n\nYes, this is the piece of code that allows us to modify sym.current_memory_ptr: it adds arg2 to it.\nFinally, the “C” branch:\n\n\n\ninstr_A switch-C\n\n\nWell, it turned out that instr_C is not the only instruction that modifies sym.written_by_instr_C: this piece of code adds arg2 to it.\nAnd that was instr_A, lets summarize it! Depending on the first argument, this instruction does the following:\n\narg1 == “M”: adds arg2 to the byte at sym.current_memory_ptr.\narg1 == “P”: steps sym.current_memory_ptr by arg2 bytes.\narg1 == “C”: adds arg2 to the value at sym.written_by_instr_C.\n\n###instr_S\nThis function is not recognized either, so we have to manually define it like we did with instr_A. After we do, and take a look at the minimap, scroll through the basic blocks, it is pretty obvious that these two functions are very-very similar. We can use rz-diff to see the difference.\n\nrizin tip: rz-diff is used to compare binary files. There’s a few options we can control the type of binary diffing the tool does, and to what kind of output format we want. One of the cool features is that it can generate DarumGrim-style bindiff graphs using the -g option.\n\nSince now we want to diff two functions from the same binary, we specify the offsets with -g, and use reverse4 for both binaries. Also, we create the graphs for comparing instr_A to instr_S and for comparing instr_S to instr_A.\n[0x00 ~]$ rz-diff -g 0x40080d,0x40089f  reverse4 reverse4 | xdot -\n\n\n\ninstr_S graph1\n\n\n[0x00 ~]$ rz-diff -g 0x40089f,0x40080d  reverse4 reverse4 | xdot -\n\n\n\ninstr_S graph2\n\n\nA sad truth reveals itself after a quick glance at these graphs: rz-diff is a liar! In theory, grey boxes should be identical, yellow ones should differ only at some offsets, and red ones should differ seriously. Well this is obviously not the case here - e.g. the larger grey boxes are clearly not identical. This is something I’m definitely going to take a deeper look at after I’ve finished this writeup.\nAnyways, after we get over the shock of being lied to, we can easily recognize that instr_S is basically a reverse-instr_A: where the latter does addition, the former does subtraction. To summarize this:\n\narg1 == “M”: subtracts arg2 from the byte at sym.current_memory_ptr.\narg1 == “P”: steps sym.current_memory_ptr backwards by arg2 bytes.\narg1 == “C”: subtracts arg2 from the value at sym.written_by_instr_C.\n\n###instr_I\n\n\n\ninstr_I\n\n\nThis one is simple, it just calls instr_A(arg1, 1). As you may have noticed the function call looks like call fcn.0040080d instead of call fcn.instr_A. This is because when you save and open a project, function names get lost - another thing to examine and patch in rizin!\n###instr_D\n\n\n\ninstr_D\n\n\nAgain, simple: it calls instr_S(arg1, 1).\n###instr_P\nIt’s local var rename time again!\n:&gt; afvn local_0_1 const_M\n:&gt; afvn local_0_2 const_P\n:&gt; afvn local_3 arg1\n\n\n\ninstr_P\n\n\nThis function is pretty straightforward also, but there is one oddity: const_M is never used. I don’t know why it is there - maybe it is supposed to be some kind of distraction? Anyways, this function simply writes arg1 to sym.current_memory_ptr, and than calls instr_I(“P”). This basically means that instr_P is used to write one byte, and put the pointer to the next byte. So far this would seem the ideal instruction to construct most of the “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!” string, but remember, this is also the one that can be used only 9 times!\n###instr_X\nAnother simple one, rename local vars anyways!\n:&gt; afvn local_1 arg1\n\n\n\ninstr_X\n\n\nThis function XORs the value at sym.current_memory_ptr with arg1.\n###instr_J\nThis one is not as simple as the previous ones, but it’s not that complicated either. Since I’m obviously obsessed with variable renaming:\n:&gt; afvn local_3 arg1\n:&gt; afvn local_0_4 arg1_and_0x3f\n\n\n\ninstr_J\n\n\nAfter the result of arg1 & 0x3f is put into a local variable, arg1 & 0x40 is checked against 0. If it isn’t zero, arg1_and_0x3f is negated:\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-09e1\n\n\nThe next branching: if arg1 &gt;= 0, then the function returns arg1_and_0x3f,\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-09e4\n\n\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-0a1a\n\n\nelse the function branches again, based on the value of sym.written_by_instr_C:\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-09ef\n\n\nIf it is zero, the function returns 2,\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-0a13\n\n\nelse it is checked if arg1_and_0x3f is a negative number,\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-09f9\n\n\nand if it is, sym.good_if_ne_zero is incremented by 1:\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-09ff\n\n\nAfter all this, the function returns with arg1_and_0x3f:\n\n\n\ninstr_J bb-0a0e",

    "text": "Well, we did the reverse engineering part, now we have to write a program for the VM with the instruction set described in the previous paragraph. Here is the program’s functional specification:\n\nthe program must return “*”\nsym.memory has to contain the string “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!” after execution\nall 9 instructions have to be used at least once\nsym.good_if_ne_zero should not be zero\ninstr_P is not allowed to be used more than 9 times\n\nSince this document is about reversing, I’ll leave the programming part to the fellow reader :) But I’m not going to leave you empty-handed, I’ll give you one advice: Except for “J”, all of the instructions are simple, easy to use, and it should not be a problem to construct the “Such VM! MuCH reV3rse!” using them. “J” however is a bit complicated compared to the others. One should realize that its sole purpose is to make sym.good_if_ne_zero bigger than zero, which is a requirement to access the flag. In order to increment sym.good_if_ne_zero, three conditions should be met:\n\narg1 should be a negative number, otherwise we would return early\nsym.written_by_instr_C should not be 0 when “J” is called. This means that “C”, “AC”, or “SC” instructions should be used before calling “J”.\narg1_and_0x3f should be negative when checked. Since 0x3f’s sign bit is zero, no matter what arg1 is, the result of arg1 & 0x3f will always be non-negative. But remember that “J” negates arg1_and_0x3f if arg1 & 0x40 is not zero. This basically means that arg1’s 6th bit should be 1 (0x40 = 01000000b). Also, because arg1_and_0x3f can’t be 0 either, at least one of arg1’s 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th bits should be 1 (0x3f = 00111111b).\n\nI think this is enough information, you can go now and write that program.
