## Getting Rizin

Binary packages are available for most common platforms (e.g., Windows, MacOS, Linux). However, you can still compile Rizin yourself for many other architectures/operating systems.

Please have a look at the [releases](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/releases) tab of Rizin's GitHub repository for the binary packages. See [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/BUILDING.md) for more detailed instructions on how to build the tool.
