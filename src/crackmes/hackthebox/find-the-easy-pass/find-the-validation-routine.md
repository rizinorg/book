# Find the validation routine

The string "Wrong Password!" is located at `0x00454200` in the CODE section.

In this step, we wish to find the password, our approach will be to debug
the program based on the information already collected.

```bash
Spawned new process with pid 8556, tid = 8576
= attach 8556 8576
bin.baddr 0x00400000
Using 0x400000
asm.bits 32
```

> ```bash
> [0x7ffeaa1c2630]> iz~Wrong
> [0x7ffeaa1c2630]> izz~Wrong
> 5483 0x00053600 0x00454200 15  16   CODE    ascii   Wrong Password!
> ```
> ***rizin tips:*** We know where is located the "Wrong Password!" at
> `0x00454200` in the CODE section.
> To do the same research, we can use the `iz` and `izz`


`~` is Rizin's built-in `grep` command which you can use to filter the
output.
Here, we've searched for the word "Wrong" in the strings of the data
section.

Seeking to `0x00454200`- the location of the string:

```bash
[0x7ffeaa1c2630]> s 0x00454200

[0x00454200]> aaaa
```

We will ask Rizin to analyze the program with `aaa`.

```bash
[0x00454200]> aaaa
[x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
[Warning: Invalid range. Use different search.in=? or analysis.in=dbg.maps.x
Warning: Invalid range. Use different search.in=? or analysis.in=dbg.maps.x
[x] Analyze function calls (aac)
[x] Analyze len bytes of instructions for references (aar)
[x] Check for classes
[TOFIX: aaft can't run in debugger mode.ions (aaft)
[x] Type matching analysis for all functions (aaft)
[x] Propagate noreturn information
[x] Use -AA or aaaa to perform additional experimental analysis.

```

```bash
[0x00454200]> V
```

Press `p` command to switch on the code view.

Press `x` to display the cross-references.

![find-the-validation-routine-wrong-password-xref](./img/find-the-validation_routine-02.png)

Press `enter` or `return` to jump of this reference.

Rizin allows you to have a graph view by pressing the `space bar`.

For the graph view to work here, Rizin needs the function to be analyzed.
We will help by creating it from the beginning of the function
where the string "Wrong Password!" is located.

Scroll up to the address `0x00454078`.

![find-the-validation-routine-wrong-password-prologue-function](./img/find-the-validation_routine-05.png)

Press `d` and `f` to analyze the function.


![find-the-validation-routine-wrong-password-analyze-function](./img/find-the-validation_routine-06.png)

Now if you press the `space bar` the graph will be displayed.

> ***rizin tips:*** to move around of graph, you can use the same keys like Vim:
> `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`.

By deduction, the address `0x00427a30` is the function which popup the messagebox.

The right node, print the "Wrong Password!", the left one, probably prints the congratulations message.

At `0x00404628` is what which looks like a validation function because it is
followed by a conditional test that either leads to the "Wrong Password!" message
or the congratulation message.

Press `g` and enter the address `0x004041dc` to check if this one is the
congratulation message.

Press `n` to ignore the create function message and press `P`.

Press `x` and `p`.
