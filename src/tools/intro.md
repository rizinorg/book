# Tools

Rizin is not just the only tool provided by the rizin project. The rest if chapters in this book are focused on explaining the use of the rizin tool, this chapter will focus on explaining all the other companion tools that are shipped inside the rizin project.

All the functionalities provided by the different APIs and plugins have also different tools to allow to use them from the commandline and integrate them with shellscripts easily.

Thanks to the orthogonal design of the framework it is possible to do all the things that rizin is able from different places:

* these companion tools
* native library apis
* scripting with rz-pipe
* the rizin shell
