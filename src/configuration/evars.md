## Configuration Variables

Below is a list of the most frequently used configuration variables. You can get a complete list by issuing `e` command without arguments. For example, to see all variables defined in the "cfg" namespace, issue `e cfg.` (mind the ending dot). You can get help on any eval configuration variable by using `el cfg.`

The `el` command to get help on all the evaluable configuration variables of rizin. As long as the output of this command is pretty large you can combine it with the internal grep `~` to filter for what you are looking for:

```
[0x00000000]> el~color
      graph.gv.graph: Graphviz global style attributes. (bgcolor=white)
       graph.gv.node: Graphviz node style. (color=gray, style=filled shape=box)
          log.colors: Should the log output use colors (TODO)
           scr.color: Enable colors (0: none, 1: ansi, 2: 256 colors, 3: truecolor)
      scr.color.args: Colorize arguments and variables of functions
     scr.color.bytes: Colorize bytes that represent the opcodes of the instruction
      scr.color.grep: Enable colors when using ~grep
       scr.color.ops: Colorize numbers and registers in opcodes
      scr.color.pipe: Enable colors when using pipes
     scr.prompt.mode: Set prompt color based on vi mode
         scr.rainbow: Shows rainbow colors depending of address
         scr.randpal: Random color palete or just get the next one from 'eco'
```

The Visual mode has an eval browser that is accessible through the `Vbe` command.

### asm.arch

Defines the target CPU architecture used for disassembling (`pd`, `pD` commands) and code analysis (`a` command). You can find the list of possible values by looking at the result of `e asm.arch=?` or `rz-asm -L`.
It is quite simple to add new architectures for disassembling and analyzing code. There is an interface for that. For x86, it is used to attach a number of third-party disassembler engines, including GNU binutils, Udis86 and a few handmade ones.

### asm.cpu

You can use this configuration variable to define the CPU type. For example, if you had picked the architecture as AVR, you can choose your CPU type (ATmega1281, ATmega2561, etc) using `asm.cpu`.

### asm.bits

Determines width in bits of registers for the current architecture. Supported values: 8, 16, 32, 64. Note that not all target architectures support all combinations for asm.bits.

### asm.syntax

Changes syntax flavor for disassembler between Intel and AT&T. At the moment, this setting affects Udis86 disassembler for Intel 32/Intel 64 targets only. Supported values are `intel` and `att`.

### asm.pseudo

A boolean value to set the psuedo syntax in the disassembly. "False" indicates a native one, defined by the current architecture, "true" activates a pseudocode strings format. For example, it'll transform :

```
│           0x080483ff      e832000000     call 0x8048436
│           0x08048404      31c0           xor eax, eax
│           0x08048406      0205849a0408   add al, byte [0x8049a84]
│           0x0804840c      83f800         cmp eax, 0
│           0x0804840f      7405           je 0x8048416
```
to

```
│           0x080483ff      e832000000     0x8048436 ()
│           0x08048404      31c0           eax = 0
│           0x08048406      0205849a0408   al += byte [0x8049a84]
│           0x0804840c      83f800         var = eax - 0
│           0x0804840f      7405           if (!var) goto 0x8048416
```
It can be useful while disassembling obscure architectures.

### asm.os

Selects a target operating system of currently loaded binary. Usually, OS is automatically detected by `rabin -rI`. Yet, `asm.os` can be used to switch to a different syscall table employed by another OS.

### asm.flags

If defined to "true", disassembler view will have flags column.

### asm.tabs

If your disassembly doesn't fit in your screen or aligns clumsily, `asm.tabs` might be of help. You can use this variable to control the distance between the operands, by setting the number of spaces, while displaying your disassembly.

For example, this is the disassemly with the variable set to 0:
```
[0x000040a7]> e asm.tabs=0
[0x000040a7]> pd 6
│           0x000040a7      push rsp
│           0x000040a8      mov r12d, edi                              ; argc
│           0x000040ab      push rbp
│           0x000040ac      mov rbp, rsi                               ; argv
│           0x000040af      push rbx
│           0x000040b0      sub rsp, 0x48
```
And here's what it would look like after setting it to 6:
```
[0x000040a7]> e asm.tabs=6
[0x000040a7]> pd 6
│           0x000040a7      push  rsp
│           0x000040a8      mov   r12d, edi                            ; argc
│           0x000040ab      push  rbp
│           0x000040ac      mov   rbp,  rsi                            ; argv
│           0x000040af      push  rbx
│           0x000040b0      sub   rsp,  0x48
```

### asm.tabs.once

This is a boolean variable that can be set to true if you want to align only the opcodes, excluding the arguments. This makes sense only if you have set `asm.tabs` on.

```
[0x00008290]> e asm.tabs=6
[0x00008290]> e asm.tabs.once=false
[0x00008290]> pd 10
│           0x00008290      mov   ip,   sp
│           0x00008294      push  {r4,  fp,   ip,   lr,   pc}
│           0x00008298      sub   fp,   ip,   4
│           0x0000829c      sub   sp,   sp,   0x24
│           0x000082a0      str   r0,   [fp,  -0x28]
│           0x000082a4      str   r1,   [fp,  -0x2c]
│           0x000082a8      ldr   r3,   [fp,  -0x28]
│           0x000082ac      cmp   r3,   1
│       ┌─< 0x000082b0      bgt   0x82c0
│       │   0x000082b4      mvn   r3,   0
```
In the above example, the opcodes and the operands are aligned. Now, turning it on would align only the opcodes.
```
[0x00008290]> e asm.tabs.once=true
[0x00008290]> pd 10
│           0x00008290      mov   ip, sp
│           0x00008294      push  {r4, fp, ip, lr, pc}
│           0x00008298      sub   fp, ip, 4
│           0x0000829c      sub   sp, sp, 0x24
│           0x000082a0      str   r0, [var_28h]
│           0x000082a4      str   r1, [var_2ch]
│           0x000082a8      ldr   r3, [var_28h]
│           0x000082ac      cmp   r3, 1
│       ┌─< 0x000082b0      bgt   0x82c0
│       │   0x000082b4      mvn   r3, 0
```

### asm.lines.call

If set to "true", draw lines at the left of the disassemble output (`pd`, `pD` commands) to graphically represent control flow changes (jumps and calls) that are targeted inside current block. Also, see `asm.lines.out`.

### asm.lines.out

When defined as "true", the disassembly view will also draw control flow lines that go outside of the block.

### asm.linestyle

A boolean value which changes the direction of control flow analysis. If set to "false", it is done from top to bottom of a block; otherwise, it goes from bottom to top. The "false" setting seems to be a better choice for improved readability and is the default one.

### asm.offset

Boolean value which controls the visibility of offsets for individual disassembled instructions.

### asm.trace

A boolean value that controls displaying of tracing information (sequence number and counter) at the left of each opcode. It is used to assist with programs trace analysis.

### asm.bytes

A boolean value used to show or hide displaying of raw bytes of instructions.

### asm.sub.reg

A boolean value used to replace register names with arguments or their associated role alias.

For example, if you have something like this:

```
│           0x080483ea      83c404         add esp, 4
│           0x080483ed      68989a0408     push 0x8049a98
│           0x080483f7      e870060000     call sym.imp.scanf
│           0x080483fc      83c408         add esp, 8
│           0x08048404      31c0           xor eax, eax
```
This variable changes it to:
```
│           0x080483ea      83c404         add SP, 4
│           0x080483ed      68989a0408     push 0x8049a98
│           0x080483f7      e870060000     call sym.imp.scanf
│           0x080483fc      83c408         add SP, 8
│           0x08048404      31c0           xor A0, A0
```

### asm.sub.jmp

A boolean value used to substitute jump, call and branch targets in disassembly.

For example, when turned on, it'd display `jal 0x80001a40` as `jal fcn.80001a40` in the disassembly.

### asm.sub.rel

A boolean value which substitutes pc relative expressions in disassembly. When turned on, it shows the references as string references.

For example:

```
0x5563844a0181      488d3d7c0e00.  lea rdi, [rip + 0xe7c]    ; str.argv__2d_:__s
```
When turned on, this variable lets you display the above instruction as:

```
0x5563844a0181      488d3d7c0e00.  lea rdi, str.argv__2d_:__s    ; 0x5563844a1004 ; "argv[%2d]: %s\n"
```

### asm.sub.section

Boolean which shows offsets in disassembly prefixed with the name of the section or map.

That means, from something like:

```
0x000067ea      488d0def0c01.  lea rcx, [0x000174e0]
```
to the one below, when toggled on.
```
0x000067ea      488d0def0c01.  lea rcx, [fmap.LOAD1.0x000174e0]
```

### asm.sub.varonly

Boolean which substitutes the variable expression with the local variable name.

For example: `var_14h` as `rbp - var_14h`, in the disassembly.

### cfg.bigendian

Change endianness. "true" means big-endian, "false" is for little-endian.
"file.id" and "file.flag" both to be true.

### cfg.newtab

If this variable is enabled, help messages will be displayed along with command names in tab completion for commands.

### scr.color

This variable specifies the mode for colorized screen output: "false" (or 0) means no colors, "true" (or 1) means 16-colors mode, 2 means 256-colors mode, 3 means 16 million-colors mode. If your favorite theme looks weird, try to bump this up.

### scr.seek

This variable accepts a full-featured expression or a pointer/flag (eg. eip). If set, rizin will set seek position to its value on startup.

### scr.scrollbar
If you have set up any [flagzones](http://book.rada.re/basic_commands/flags.html#flag-zones) (`fz?`), this variable will let you display the scrollbar with the flagzones, in Visual mode. Set it to `1` to display the scrollbar at the right end, `2` for the top and `3` to display it at the bottom.

### scr.utf8

A boolen variable to show UTF-8 characters instead of ANSI.

### cfg.fortunes

Enables or disables "fortune" messages displayed at each rizin start.

### cfg.fortunes.file

Rizin has two types for fortunes: tips and fun. Fortunes of the type 'tips' are general tips to help you use Rizin better, whereas the other one prints some lighthearted jokes. You can choose which type of fortune to display, using this variable.

```
[0x00000000]> e cfg.fortunes.file=tips
[0x00000000]> fo
 -- Bindiff two files with '$ rz_diff /bin/true /bin/false'
[0x00000000]> e cfg.fortunes.file=fun
[0x00000000]> fo
 -- Welcome to "IDA - the roguelike"
[0x00000000]>
```
Rizin also supports custom fortunes. You can save your fortunes in a file and provide the relative or absolute path to the same variable, to have them displayed at the startup.

```
[0x00000000]> e cfg.fortunes.file=/path/to/my/fortunes.txt
```

Please make sure that you add these in your `~/.rizinrc` to preserve the changes when you reopen rizin.

### stack.size

This variable lets you set the size of stack in bytes.
