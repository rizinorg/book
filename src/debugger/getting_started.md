# Getting Started

## Small session in Rizin debugger

* `rizin -d /bin/ls`: Opens rizin with file `/bin/ls` in debugger mode using the rizin native debugger,
  but does not run the program. Youâ€™ll see a prompt (rizin) - all examples are from this prompt.

* `db @ flag`: place a breakpoint at flag, where flag can be either an address or a function name

* `db- @ flag`: remove the breakpoint at flag, where flag can be either an address or a function name

* `dbl`: show list of breakpoint

* `dc`: run the program

* `dr`: Show registers state

* `drr`: Show registers references (telescoping) (like peda)

* `ds`: Step into instruction

* `dso`: Step over instruction

* `dbt`: Display backtrace

* `dm`: Show memory maps

* `dk <signal>`: Send KILL signal to child

* `ood`: reopen in debug mode

* `ood arg1 arg2`: reopen in debug mode with arg1 and arg2
