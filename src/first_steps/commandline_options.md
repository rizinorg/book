## Shell Command-line Options

The `rizin` command line tool supports various options from the shell command line.

Here is the usage help message:

```bash
$ rizin -h

 -w           open file in write mode
 -x           open without exec-flag (asm.emu will not work), See io.exec
 -X           same as -e bin.usextr=false (useful for dyldcache)
 -z, -zz      do not load strings or load them even in raw
```

### Common usage patterns

- To open a file in write mode without parsing the file format headers, use the following command:

```bash
$ rizin -nw file
```

- To quickly enter an Rizin shell without opening any file, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ rizin 
```

- To quickly enter an Rizin shell and allocate 512 bytes of writable buffer (equivalent of `malloc://512`), you can use the following command:

```bash
$ rizin = 
```

- To specify which architecture and bits you want to open the file with, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ rizin -a ppc -b 32 ls.fat
```

- To run a script **before** before the file is opened, you can use the `-i` option followed by the path to your script. Here's an example:

```bash
$ rizin -i /path/to/patch.rz target.bin
```

- To execute a command and quit without entering the interactive mode in Rizin, you can use the `-qc` option followed by the command you want to execute. Here's an example:

```bash
$ rizin -qc 'iij' hi.bin > imports.json
```

- To set a environment variable in Rizin, you can use the `-e` option followed by the environment variable assignment. Here's an example:

```bash
$ rizin -e "pdb.server=https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols" blah.bin
```

- To debug a program using Rizin, you can use the following option:

```bash
$ rizin -d /bin/ls
```

- To use an existing project file in Rizin, you can specify the project file when opening Rizin. Here's an example:

```bash
$ rizin -p test.rzdb
```
