## Downloading rizin

You can get rizin from the website, [http://rizin.re](http://rizin.re),
or the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin)

Binary packages will soon be available for most common platforms (e.g. Windows, MacOS, Linux), however you can still compile rizin yourself for many other architectures/operating systems.

Please have a look at file [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/BUILDING.md) in Rizin repository for more detailed instructions on how to build the tool.
